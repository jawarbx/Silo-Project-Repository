Although TMA lesions are often accompanied by clinical features of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ischemic end-organ injury, renal-limited forms of TMA are not infrequently encountered in clinical practice. The presence of renal-limited manifestations can be diagnostically challenging, often delaying the initiation of targeted therapy. Prompt investigation and empirical treatment of TMA is warranted to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Major advances have been made with respect to the pathophysiology of primary TMA entities, with the subsequent development of novel diagnostic tools and lifesaving therapies for diseases like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and complement-mediated TMA. This article will review the clinical presentation and pathologic hallmarks of TMA involving the kidney, and the disease-specific mechanisms that contribute to the endothelial injury that characterizes TMA lesions. Diagnostic approach and both empirical and disease-specific treatment strategies will be discussed, along with the potential role for emerging targeted disease-specific therapies.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Thrombotic Microangiopathies,Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic,Anemia, Hemolytic,Kidney,Plasma Exchange","D006801,D057049,D011697,D000743,D007668,D010951",5,5,"Journal Article,Review,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Continuous KRT comprises a spectrum of dialysis modalities preferably used to provide kidney support to patients with AKI who are hemodynamically unstable and critically ill. The various continuous KRT modalities are distinguished by different mechanisms of solute transport and use of dialysate and/or replacement solutions. Considerable variation exists in the application of continuous KRT due to a lack of standardization in how the treatments are prescribed, delivered, and optimized to improve patient outcomes. In this manuscript, we present an overview of the therapy, recent clinical trials, and outcome studies. We review the indications for continuous KRT and the technical aspects of the treatment, including continuous KRT modality, vascular access, dosing of continuous KRT, anticoagulation, volume management, nutrition, and continuous KRT complications.

Electronic address: joanne.bargman@uhn.ca.","As the global prevalence of peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to grow, practitioners must be equipped with prescribing strategies that focus on the needs and preferences of patients. PD is an effective form of kidney replacement therapy that offers numerous benefits to patients, including more flexibility in schedules compared with in-center hemodialysis (HD). Additional benefits of PD include salt and water removal without significant changes in patient hemodynamics. This continuous yet gentle removal of solutes and fluid is associated with better-preserved residual kidney function. Unfortunately, sometimes these advantages are overlooked at the expense of an emphasis on achieving small solute clearance targets. A more patient-centered approach emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment, particularly when considering incremental PD and other prescriptions that align with lifestyle preferences. In shifting the focus from small solute clearance targets to patient needs and clinical goals, PD remains an attractive, patient-centered form of kidney replacement therapy.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Renal Dialysis,Peritoneal Dialysis,Renal Replacement Therapy,Prescriptions,Water,Kidney Failure, Chronic","D006801,D006435,D010530,D017582,D055656,D014867,D007676",2,2,"Journal Article,Review,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The exact indications for initiating KRT have been debated for decades. There is a general consensus that KRT should be considered in patients with AKI and medically refractory complications (""urgent indications""). ""Relative indications"" are more common but defined with less precision. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence from recent landmark clinical trials, discuss strategies to anticipate the need for KRT in individual patients, and propose an algorithm for decision making. We emphasize that the decision to consider KRT should be made in conjunction with other forms of organ support therapies and important nonkidney factors, including the patient's preferences and overall goals of care. We also suggest future research to differentiate patients who benefit from timely initiation of KRT from those with imminent recovery of kidney function. Until then, efforts are needed to optimize the initiation and delivery of KRT in routine clinical practice, to minimize nonessential variation, and to ensure that patients with persistent AKI or progressive organ failure affected by AKI receive KRT in a timely manner.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,"S.M.

The paramount difficulty in the management of IgA nephropathy is the heterogeneity in its clinical presentation and prognosis, requiring an individualized treatment approach. Goal-directed supportive care remains the bedrock of therapy for all patients, regardless of risk of progression. Sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors and sparsentan should be integral to contemporary supportive care, particularly in patients with chronic kidney damage. Pending the development of reliable biomarkers, it remains a challenge to identify patients prone to progression due to active disease and most likely to derive a net benefit from immunosuppression. The use of clinical parameters, including the degree of proteinuria, the presence of persistent microscopic hematuria, and the rate of eGFR loss, combined with the mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, crescents score, is currently the best approach. Systemic glucocorticoids are indicated in high-risk patients, but the beneficial effects wane after withdrawal and come at the price of substantial treatment-associated toxicity. Therapies with direct effect on disease pathogenesis are increasingly becoming available. While targeted-release budesonide has garnered the most attention, anti-B-cell strategies and selective complement inhibition will most likely prove their added value.

The nephrologist may be involved in poisonings that cause kidney disease and for targeted treatments. The overall approach to the poisoned patient involves the initial acute resuscitation and performing a risk assessment, whereby the exposure is considered in terms of the anticipated severity and in the context of the patient's status and treatments that may be required. Time-critical interventions such as gastrointestinal decontamination ( e.g. , activated charcoal) and antidotes are administered when indicated. The nephrologist is usually involved when elimination enhancement techniques are required, such as urine alkalinization or extracorporeal treatments. There is increasing data to guide decision making for the use of extracorporeal treatments in the poisoned patient. Principles to consider are clinical indications such as whether severe toxicity is present, anticipated, and/or will persist and whether the poison will be significantly removed by the extracorporeal treatment. Extracorporeal clearance is maximized for low-molecular weight drugs that are water soluble with minimal protein binding (<80%) and low endogenous clearance and volume of distribution. The dosage of some antidotes ( e.g. , N-acetylcysteine, ethanol, fomepizole) should be increased to maintain therapeutic concentrations once the extracorporeal treatment is initiated. To maximize the effect of an extracorporeal treatment, blood and effluent flows should be optimized, the filter with the largest surface area selected, and duration tailored to remove enough poison to reduce toxicity. Intermittent hemodialysis is recommended in most cases when an extracorporeal treatment is required because it is the most efficient, and continuous kidney replacement therapy is prescribed in some circumstances, particularly if intermittent hemodialysis is not readily available.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,,9.8,"Humans,Antidotes,Charcoal,Acetylcysteine,Ethanol,Poisons,Poisoning","D006801,D000931,D002606,D000111,D000431,D011042,D011041",2,2,Journal Article

Intradialytic fatigue develops or worsens immediately before hemodialysis and persists through the dialysis treatment. Little is known about associated risk factors or pathophysiology, although it may relate to a classic conditioning response. Postdialysis fatigue (PDF) develops or worsens after hemodialysis and may persist for hours. There is no consensus on how to measure PDF. Estimates for the prevalence of PDF range from 20%-86%, likely due to variation in methods of ascertainment and participant characteristics. Several hypotheses seek to explain the pathophysiology of PDF, including inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and osmotic and fluid shifts, but none is currently supported by compelling or consistent data. PDF is associated with several clinical factors, including cardiovascular and hemodynamic effects of the dialysis procedure, laboratory abnormalities, depression, and physical inactivity. Clinical trials have reported hypothesis-generating data about the utility of cold dialysate, frequent dialysis, clearance of large middle molecules, treatment of depression, and exercise as potential treatments.

This installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology emphasizes the latest data available for prevention and management of infectious and noninfectious complications of PD. Through case vignettes, appropriate strategies for diagnosis and care of patients with PD peritonitis are reviewed as well as noninfectious complications evident in clinical practice including complications from increased intra-abdominal pressure, namely pericatheter and abdominal leaks, hernia formation, and complications from pleuroperitoneal communication (hydrothorax). Although rates of incisional hernias and pericatheter leaks have decreased with improved peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion techniques, these mechanical complications continue to be common occurrences and are reviewed via pertinent clinical vignettes which aim to address and discuss common implications of these scenarios. Finally, this Core Curriculum article covers a practical overview of peritoneal dialysis catheter dysfunction.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Peritoneal Dialysis,Peritonitis,Catheterization,Kidney Failure, Chronic","D006801,D010530,D010538,D002404,D007676",1,1,"Journal Article,Review"

Electronic address: juancarlos.velez@ochsner.org.","Individuals with liver disease are susceptible to pathophysiological derangements that lead to kidney dysfunction. Patients with advanced cirrhosis and acute liver failure (ALF) are at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1, also called HRS-AKI) constitutes a form of AKI unique to the state of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Although HRS-1 is a condition primarily characterized by marked renal vasoconstriction and kidney hypoperfusion, other pathogenic processes, such as acute tubular injury and renal vein congestion, can overlap and further complicate the course of HRS-1. ALF can lead to AKI through mechanisms that involve systemic inflammation, direct drug toxicity, or bile acid-induced tubulopathy. In addition, the growing prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is changing the spectrum of chronic kidney disease in cirrhosis. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we explore the underpinnings of how cirrhosis, ALF, acute cholestasis, and post-liver transplantation can be associated with various forms of acute, subacute, or chronic kidney diseases. We navigate through the recommended therapies for each condition, including supportive care, pharmacological interventions, kidney replacement therapy, and organ transplantation.

Decisions regarding fluid removal during critical illness are complex even for patients with preserved kidney function. This article seeks to apply general concepts of fluid management to the care of patients who also require KRT. Because optimal fluid management for any specific patient is likely to change over the course of critical illness, conceptual models using phases of care have been developed. In this review, we will examine the implications of one such model on the use of ultrafiltration during KRT for volume removal in distributive shock. This will also provide a useful lens to re-examine published data of KRT during critical illness. We will highlight recent prospective trials of KRT as well as recent retrospective studies examining ultrafiltration rate and mortality, review the results, and discuss applications and shortcomings of these studies. We also emphasize that current data and techniques suggest that optimal guidelines will not consist of recommendations for or against absolute fluid removal rates but will instead require the development of dynamic protocols involving frequent cycles of reassessment and adjustment of net fluid removal goals. If optimal fluid management is dynamic, then frequent assessment of fluid responsiveness, fluid toxicity, and tolerance of fluid removal will be needed. Innovations in our ability to assess these parameters may improve our management of ultrafiltration in the future.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,K23 DK129770/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States ,,9.8,"Humans,Critical Illness,Renal Replacement Therapy,Critical Care,Ultrafiltration,Fluid Therapy,Acute Kidney Injury","D006801,D016638,D017582,D003422,D014462,D005440,D058186",2,4,"Review,Journal Article"

Dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diet have recently emerged as potential strategies to induce metabolic reprogramming and slow ADPKD progression. We review the available evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of these interventions in ADPKD. Dietary interventions show promise in managing ADPKD by improving metabolic health and reducing oxidative stress. However, while preclinical studies have shown favorable outcomes, limited clinical evidence supports their effectiveness. In addition, the long-term consequences of these dietary interventions, including their effect on adverse events in patients with ADPKD, remain uncertain. To optimize ADPKD management, patients are advised to follow a dietary regimen that aims to achieve or maintain an ideal body weight and includes high fluid intake, low sodium, and limited concentrated sweets. Caloric restriction seems particularly beneficial for patients with overweight or obesity because it promotes weight loss and improves metabolic parameters. Supplementation with curcumin, ginkgolide B, saponins, vitamin E, niacinamide, or triptolide has demonstrated uncertain clinical benefit in patients with ADPKD. Notably, β -hydroxybutyrate supplements have shown promise in animal models; however, their safety and efficacy in ADPKD require further evaluation through well-designed clinical trials. Therefore, the use of these supplements is not currently recommended for patients with ADPKD. In summary, dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diet hold promise in ADPKD management by enhancing metabolic health. However, extensive clinical research is necessary to establish their effectiveness and long-term effects. Adhering to personalized dietary guidelines, including weight management and specific nutritional restrictions, can contribute to optimal ADPKD management. Future research should prioritize well-designed clinical trials to determine the benefits and safety of dietary interventions and supplementation in ADPKD.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,R01 DK129259/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States ,"F.T.

MicroRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury, and miR-20a-5p was found to be the most significantly upregulated gene in a DGF patient cohort. However, the roles of microRNAs in transplanted kidneys remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that miR-20a-5p was upregulated in the kidneys of acute kidney injury mice and in patients with DGF. We identified early growth response-1 as a critical upstream target and verified the binding of early growth response-1 to a predicted sequence in the promoter region of the miR-20a-5p gene. Functionally, the miR-20a-5p mimic attenuated IRI and postischemic renal fibrosis, whereas the miR-20a-5p inhibitor delivery aggravated IRI and fibrosis. Importantly, delivery of the miR-20a-5p mimic or inhibitor in the donor kidneys attenuated or aggravated renal loss and structural damage in cold storage transplantation injury. Furthermore, our study identified miR-20a-5p as a negative regulator of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) by targeting the 3' untranslated region of ACSL4 mRNA, thereby inhibiting ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis. Our results suggest a potential therapeutic application of miR-20a-5p in kidney transplantation through the inhibition of ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Animals,Mice,Ferroptosis,MicroRNAs,Kidney,Reperfusion Injury,Acute Kidney Injury,Ischemia,Coenzyme A Ligases","D000818,D051379,D000079403,D035683,D007668,D015427,D058186,D007511,D003066",4,13,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Electronic address: david.cherney@uhn.ca.","Concerns about hyperkalemia may result in the underuse of established and novel therapies that improve kidney and/or cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hyperkalemia-related issues are of particular relevance in patients with CKD, who are commonly receiving other hyperkalemia-inducing agents such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. In contrast, sodium/glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors mitigate the risk of serious hyperkalemia in clinical trials. We aim to review recent evidence surrounding the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with T2DM and CKD treated with established and novel therapies for diabetic kidney disease, focusing on SGLT2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. We conclude that SGLT2 inhibitors can be used safely in patients with T2DM at high CV risk with CKD without increasing the risk of hyperkalemia. Routine potassium monitoring is generally required when finerenone is used as a kidney- and CV-protective agent in patients with T2DM. Based on existing data, when added to the standard of care, combining SGLT2 inhibitors with finerenone is safe and has the potential to exert additional cardiorenal benefits in patients with diabetic kidney disease. The use of potassium binders should be considered to enable optimal doses of guideline-based therapies for patients with diabetic kidney disease to maximize the kidney and CV benefits.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Hyperkalemia,Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Diabetic Nephropathies,Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors,Renal Insufficiency, Chronic,Potassium","D006801,D006947,D000451,D003924,D003928,D000077203,D051436,D011188",3,3,"Journal Article,Review,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

This high burden of disease, which incurs sizeable morbidity, may be worsening with the proportion of high-risk D+/R- solid organ transplantation recipients increasing in some regions globally. Cohort studies continue to support either universal prophylaxis or preemptive therapy as effective prevention strategies. Letermovir prophylaxis was noninferior to valganciclovir in adult high-risk D+/R- kidney transplant recipients with fewer drug-related adverse events in a recent clinical trial and has now been approved for such use in some regions. Maribavir preemptive therapy failed to demonstrate noninferiority when compared with valganciclovir in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients but looked promising for safety. Donor matching could be useful in prevention CMV disease with a survival advantage demonstrated in seronegative recipients waiting up to 30 mo for a seronegative kidney. Immune-guided prophylaxis resulted in fewer CMV infection episodes in lung transplant recipients when compared with fixed-duration prophylaxis in a recent clinical trial. For treatment of refractory or resistant CMV infection, maribavir was more efficacious and better tolerated when compared with investigator-initiated therapy in its registration trial for this condition. Further research regarding best treatment and prophylaxis of resistant or refractory CMV infection is needed to reflect best clinical practice choices. Optimal use of immune globulin or CMV-specific T cells for prevention or treatment of CMV disease remains undefined.

Consequently, ensuring persistent use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in CKD has long been a major clinical priority. In this joint analysis of the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trials, the relative risk of discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was reduced by 15% in patients randomized to sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This effect was more pronounced in patients with urine albumin:creatinine ratio ≥1000 mg/g, for whom the absolute benefits of these medications are the greatest.

In FIDELITY, a prespecified pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, finerenone improved heart-kidney outcomes in participants with CKD and type 2 diabetes. Methods This FIDELITY subgroup analysis investigated the effects of finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Efficacy outcomes included a cardiovascular composite (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) and a kidney composite (kidney failure, sustained ≥57% decrease in eGFR from baseline, or kidney disease death). Results Of 13,023 participants, 890 (7%) had stage 4 CKD. The hazard ratio for risk of cardiovascular composite outcome with finerenone versus placebo was 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.57-1.07). The kidney composite outcome proportional hazards assumption was not met for the overall study period, with a protective effect only shown up to 2 years, after which the direction of association was inconsistent and an observed loss of precision over time incurred on finerenone versus placebo risk differences. Nonetheless, albuminuria and rate of eGFR decline were consistently reduced with finerenone versus placebo. Adverse events were balanced between treatment arms. Hyperkalemia was the most common AE reported (stage 4 CKD: 26% and 13% for finerenone versus placebo, respectively) however, the incidence of hyperkalemia leading to permanent discontinuation was low (stage 4 CKD: 3% and 2% for finerenone versus placebo, respectively). Conclusions The cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD were consistent with the overall FIDELITY population; this was also the case for albuminuria and the rate of eGFR decline. The effects on the composite kidney outcome were not consistent over time.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,,9.8,,,16,17,Journal Article

The burden of treatment on PD, however, remains considerable and underpins the need for person-centered care. This reflects the need to address the patient as a person with needs and preferences beyond just the medical perspective. Shared decision making is central to the recent International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommendations for prescribing PD, balancing the potential benefits of PD on patient well-being with the burden associated with treatment. This review considers the role of high-quality goal-directed prescribing, incremental dialysis, and remote patient monitoring in reducing the burden of dialysis, including an approach to implementing incremental PD. Although patient-related outcomes are important in assessing the response to treatment and, particularly life participation, the corollary of dialysis burden, there are no clear routes to the clinical implementation of patient-related outcome measures. Delivering person-centered care is dependent on treating people both as individuals and as equal partners in their care.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,"E.A.

In this multicenter cohort study of 52,333 hospitalized Chinese neonates, the authors proposed serum cystatin C-related criteria (CyNA) for neonatal AKI. They found that cystatin C (Cys-C) is a robust and sensitive biomarker for identifying AKI in neonates who are at an elevated risk of in-hospital mortality and that CyNA detects 6.5 times as many cases as the modified Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria.

The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis has proposed however that such targets should no longer be imposed. The Society's new guidelines suggest rather that the PD prescription should be adjusted to achieve well-being in individual patients. The relaxation of treatment targets could allow increased use of PD. Measurement of solute levels in patients receiving dialysis individualized to relieve uremic symptoms could also help us identify the solutes responsible for those symptoms and then devise new means to limit their accumulation.

Both factors apply to primary aldosteronism, which is woefully underdiagnosed as a cause of hypertension and end-organ damage. Screening tests should be strongly considered for diseases that pose significant morbidity or mortality if left untreated, that have a high prevalence, and that have treatments that lead to improvement or cure. In this review we present the evidence for each of these points. We outline studies that estimate the prevalence of primary aldosteronism in different at-risk populations and how its recognition has changed over time. We also evaluate myriad studies of screening rates for primary aldosteronism and what factors do and do not influence current screening practices. We discuss the ideal conditions for screening, measuring the aldosterone to renin ratio in different populations that use plasma renin activity or direct renin concentration, and the steps for diagnostic workup of primary aldosteronism. Finally, we conclude with potential strategies to implement higher rates of screening and diagnosis of this common, consequential, and treatable disease.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Hyperaldosteronism,Aldosterone,Renin,Hypertension,Diagnosis, Differential","D006801,D006929,D000450,D012083,D006973,D003937",2,2,"Journal Article,Review"

Clinically, the risks of complicated thrombosis and bleeding have become important concerns in the treatment of nephropathies, especially nephrotic syndrome, CKD, ESKD, and patients with nephropathy undergoing RRTs. Adverse effects of anticoagulant or procoagulant therapies in patients with nephropathy, especially anticoagulation-related nephropathy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and bleeding, seriously worsen the prognosis of patients, which have become challenges for clinicians. Over the decades, the interaction between the kidney and the coagulation system has been widely studied. However, the effects of the kidney on the coagulation system have not been systematically investigated. Although some coagulation-related proteins and signaling pathways have been shown to improve coagulation abnormalities while avoiding additional kidney damage in certain kidney diseases, their potential as anticoagulation targets in nephropathy requires further investigation. Here, we review the progression of research on the crosstalk between the coagulation system and kidney diseases and systematically analyze the significance and shortcomings of previous studies to provide new sight into future research.

A Subphenotype analysis could refine frailty measurement. In a 3-center pilot cohort study, we measured frailty by the Short Physical Performance Battery, body composition, and serum biomarkers reflecting causes of frailty. We applied latent class modeling for these baseline data. Next, we tested class construct validity with disability, waitlist delisting/death, and early postoperative complications. Among 422 lung transplant candidates, 2 class model fit the best (P = .01). Compared with Subphenotype 1 (n = 333), Subphenotype 2 (n = 89) was characterized by systemic and innate inflammation (higher IL-6, CRP, PTX3, TNF-R1, and IL-1RA); mitochondrial stress (higher GDF-15 and FGF-21); sarcopenia; malnutrition; and lower hemoglobin and walk distance. Subphenotype 2 had a worse disability and higher risk of waitlist delisting or death (hazards ratio: 4.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.8-9.1). Of the total cohort, 257 underwent transplant (Subphenotype 1: 196; Subphenotype 2: 61). Subphenotype 2 had a higher need for take back to the operating room (48% vs 28%; P = .005) and longer posttransplant hospital length of stay (21 days [interquartile range: 14-33] vs 18 days [14-28]; P = .04). Subphenotype 2 trended toward fewer ventilator-free days, needing more postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis, and higher need for discharge to rehabilitation facilities (P ≤ .20). In this early phase study, we identified biological frailty Subphenotypes in lung transplant candidates.

However, early diagnosis of graft injury remains challenging, mainly because of the lack of accurate and noninvasive diagnostic techniques. Improving graft outcomes is equally demanding, as is the development of innovative therapies. Many research efforts are focusing on extracellular vesicles, cellular particles free in each body fluid that have shown promising results as precise markers of damage and potential therapeutic targets in many diseases, including the renal field. In fact, through their receptors and cargo, they act in damage response and immune modulation. In transplantation, they may be used to determine organ quality and aging, the presence of delayed graft function, rejection, and many other transplant-related pathologies. Moreover, their low immunogenicity and safe profile make them ideal for drug delivery and the development of therapies to improve KT outcomes. In this review, we summarize current evidence about extracellular vesicles in KT, starting with their characteristics and major laboratory techniques for isolation and characterization.

In the development cohort of 959 patients, no additional parameters aiding the tool were detected, but replacing the GFR with creatinine identified an additional cutoff. The parameter interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was modified to allow wider access, risk points were reweighted, and a fourth risk group was created, improving predictive ability (C=0.831).

These risks may be amplified in older incompatible living donor kidney transplant (ILDKT) recipients who undergo desensitization and intense immunosuppression. In a 25-center cohort of ILDKT recipients transplanted between September 24, 1997, and December 15, 2016, we compared mortality, DCGF, delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR), and length of stay (LOS) between 234 older (age ≥60 years) and 1172 younger (age 18-59 years) recipients. To investigate whether the impact of age was different for ILDKT recipients compared to 17 542 CLDKT recipients, we used an interaction term to determine whether the relationship between posttransplant outcomes and transplant type (ILDKT vs CLDKT) was modified by age. Overall, older recipients had higher mortality (hazard ratio: <sub>1.63</sub>2.07<sub>2.65</sub>, P < .001), lower DCGF (hazard ratio: <sub>0.36</sub>0.53<sub>0.77</sub>, P = .001), and AR (odds ratio: <sub>0.39</sub>0.54<sub>0.74</sub>, P < .001), and similar DGF (odds ratio: <sub>0.46</sub>1.03<sub>2.33</sub>, P = .9) and LOS (incidence rate ratio: <sub>0.88</sub>0.98<sub>1.10</sub>, P = 0.8) compared to younger recipients. The impact of age on mortality (interaction P = .052), DCGF (interaction P = .7), AR interaction P = .2), DGF (interaction P = .9), and LOS (interaction P = .5) were similar in ILDKT and CLDKT recipients.

Sharing some features with atherosclerosis, CAV results in diffuse narrowing of the epicardial coronaries and microvasculature, with consequent graft ischemia. Recently, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has emerged as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. We aimed to investigate the relationship between CHIP and posttransplant outcomes, including CAV. We analyzed 479 HT recipients with stored DNA samples at 2 high-volume transplant centers, Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We explored the association between the presence of CHIP mutations with CAV and mortality after HT. In this case-control analysis, carriers of CHIP mutations were not at increased risk of CAV or mortality after HT.

Despite no change in in vitro suppressive function, transfer of ex vivo expanded regulatory T cells transduced to overexpress G protein-coupled receptor 15 or C-C motif chemokine receptor 9, specific homing receptors for colon or small intestine, respectively, lessened graft-versus-host disease severity in mice. Increased regulatory T cell frequency and retention within the gastrointestinal tissues of mice that received gut homing T cells correlated with lower inflammation and gut damage early post-transplant, decreased graft-versus-host disease severity, and prolonged survival compared with those receiving control transduced regulatory T cells.

Prolonged Intermittent Kidney Replacement Therapy.,36041792,"Zoey Levine,Anitha Vijayan","Division of Nephrology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri.","Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is a vital, supportive treatment for patients with critical illness and severe AKI. The optimal timing, dose, and modality of KRT have been studied extensively, but gaps in knowledge remain. With respect to modalities, continuous KRT and intermittent hemodialysis are well-established options, but prolonged intermittent KRT is becoming more prevalent worldwide, particularly in emerging countries. Compared with continuous KRT, prolonged intermittent KRT offers similar hemodynamic stability and overall cost savings, and its intermittent nature allows patients time off therapy for mobilization and procedures. When compared with intermittent hemodialysis, prolonged intermittent KRT offers more hemodynamic stability, particularly in patients who remain highly vulnerable to hypotension from aggressive ultrafiltration over a shorter duration of treatment. The prescription of prolonged intermittent KRT can be tailored to patients' progression in their recovery from critical illness, and the frequency, flow rates, and duration of treatment can be modified to avert hemodynamic instability during de-escalation of care. Dosing of prolonged intermittent KRT can be extrapolated from urea kinetics used to calculate clearance for continuous KRT and intermittent hemodialysis. Practice variations across institutions with respect to terminology, prescription, and dosing of prolonged intermittent KRT create significant challenges, especially in creating specific drug dosing recommendations during prolonged intermittent KRT. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, prolonged intermittent KRT was rapidly implemented to meet the KRT demands during patient surges in some of the medical centers overwhelmed by sheer volume of patients with AKI. Ideally, implementation of prolonged intermittent KRT at any institution should be conducted in a timely manner, with judicious planning and collaboration among nephrology, critical care, dialysis and intensive care nursing, and pharmacy leadership. Future analyses and clinical trials with respect to prescription and delivery of prolonged intermittent KRT and clinical outcomes will help to guide standardization of practice.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,"A.

In this meta-epidemiological study, including 804 studies that were critically appraised by expert reviewers, the authors have identified all prognostic kidney transplant biomarkers and showed overall suboptimal study designs, methods, results, interpretation, reproducible research standards, and transparency. The authors also demonstrated for the first time that the limited number of studies challenged the added value of their candidate biomarkers against standard-of-care routine patient monitoring parameters. Most biomarker studies tended to be single-center, retrospective studies with a small number of patients and clinical events. Less than 5% of the studies performed an external validation. The authors also showed the poor transparency reporting and identified a data beautification phenomenon.

A retrospective (2016-2021) observational cohort study was performed in 14 INCREMENT-SOT centers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02852902; Impact of Specific Antimicrobials and MIC Values on the Outcome of Bloodstream Infections Due to ESBL- or Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales in Solid Organ Transplantation: an Observational Multinational Study). Outcomes were 14-day and 30-day clinical success (complete resolution of attributable manifestations, adequate source control, and negative follow-up blood cultures) and 30-day all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses adjusted for the propensity score to receive CAZ-AVI were constructed. Among 210 SOT recipients with CPKP-BSI, 149 received active primary therapy with CAZ-AVI (66/149) or BAT (83/149). Patients treated with CAZ-AVI had higher 14-day (80.7% vs 60.6%, P = .011) and 30-day (83.1% vs 60.6%, P = .004) clinical success and lower 30-day mortality (13.25% vs 27.3%, P = .053) than those receiving BAT. In the adjusted analysis, CAZ-AVI increased the probability of 14-day (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-6.84; P = .044) and 30-day clinical success (aOR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.17-8.40; P = .023). In contrast, CAZ-AVI therapy was not independently associated with 30-day mortality. In the CAZ-AVI group, combination therapy was not associated with better outcomes.

Electronic address: dkcooper@mgh.harvard.edu.////Center for Transplantation Sciences, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.","Progress in pig organ xenotransplantation has been made largely through (1) genetic engineering of the organ-source pig to protect its tissues from the human innate immune response, and (2) development of an immunosuppressive regimen based on blockade of the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway to prevent the adaptive immune response. In the 1980s, after transplantation into nonhuman primates (NHPs), wild-type (genetically unmodified) pig organs were rejected within minutes or hours. In the 1990s, organs from pigs expressing a human complement-regulatory protein (CD55) transplanted into NHPs receiving intensive conventional immunosuppressive therapy functioned for days or weeks. When costimulation blockade was introduced in 2000, the adaptive immune response was suppressed more readily. The identification of galactose-α1,3-galactose as the major antigen target for human and NHP anti-pig antibodies in 1991 allowed for deletion of expression of galactose-α1,3-galactose in 2003, extending pig graft survival for up to 6 months. Subsequent gene editing to overcome molecular incompatibilities between the pig and primate coagulation systems proved additionally beneficial. The identification of 2 further pig carbohydrate xenoantigens allowed the production of 'triple-knockout' pigs that are preferred for clinical organ transplantation. These combined advances enabled the first clinical pig heart transplant to be performed and opened the door to formal clinical trials.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,U01 AI153612/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States U19 AI090959/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States ,,8.8,"Animals,Humans,Animals, Genetically Modified,Transplantation, Heterologous,Galactose,Graft Rejection,Primates,Graft Survival,Complement System Proteins","D000818,D006801,D030801,D014183,D005690,D006084,D011323,D006085,D003165",2,2,"Journal Article,Review,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

The pathogenesis of CST injury remains poorly understood, and effective therapies are not available. This study has demonstrated an important role of microRNAs in CST injury and revealed the changes in microRNA expression profiles. Specifically, microRNA-147 (miR-147) is consistently elevated during CST injury in mice and in dysfunctional renal grafts in humans. Mechanistically, NDUFA4 (a key component of mitochondrial respiration complex) is identified as a direct target of miR-147. By repressing NDUFA4, miR-147 induces mitochondrial damage and renal tubular cell death.

Psychological problems and poorer quality of life are notable among children undergoing transplantation and can have long-lasting consequences and affect immunosuppressive therapy adherence. Pet ownership and animal contact have been associated with physical, mental, and social health benefits. Despite these potential benefits, however, companion animals are known to be a source of infection, which is one of the main concerns for clinicians. Because of immunosuppression, these children are particularly vulnerable to infections. Zoonoses comprise a long list of infectious diseases and represent a major public health problem. Nevertheless, many families and most healthcare providers are unaware of these potential risks, and there is a worrisome lack of recommendations to manage the risk-benefit balance, which could pose a risk for acquiring a zoonosis. Furthermore, no data are available on the number of transplanted patients with pets, and this risk-benefit balance is difficult to adequately evaluate. In this document, we review the currently available evidence regarding the epidemiology of zoonotic infections in patients undergoing transplantation, focusing on pediatric patients from a risk-benefit perspective, to help inform decision-making for clinicians. Families and healthcare professionals should be aware of the risks, and clinicians should actively screen for pets and offer comprehensive information as part of routine clinical practice. A multidisciplinary approach will ensure proper care of patients and pets and will establish preventive measures to ensure patients are safe living with their pets.",Transplantation,,The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,6.2,"Animals,Humans,Pets,Transplant Recipients,Ownership,Quality of Life,Zoonoses,Risk Assessment","D000818,D006801,D057805,D066027,D010067,D011788,D015047,D018570",5,8,"Review,Journal Article"

Electronic address: crebhol1@jhu.edu.","Nutritional epidemiology seeks to understand nutritional determinants of disease in human populations using experimental and observational study designs. Though randomized controlled trials provide the strongest evidence of causality, the expense and difficulty of sustaining adherence to dietary interventions are substantial barriers to investigating dietary determinants of kidney disease. Therefore, nutritional epidemiology commonly employs observational study designs, particularly prospective cohort studies, to investigate long-term associations between dietary exposures and kidney disease. Due to the covarying nature and synergistic effects of dietary components, holistic characterizations of dietary exposures that simultaneously consider patterns of foods and nutrients regularly consumed are generally more relevant to disease etiology than single nutrients or foods. Dietary intakes have traditionally been self-reported and are subject to bias. Statistical methods including energy adjustment and regression calibration can reduce random and systematic measurement errors associated with self-reported diet. Novel approaches that assess diet more objectively are gaining popularity but have not yet fully replaced self-report and require refinement and validation in populations with chronic kidney disease. More accurate and frequent diet assessment in existing and future studies will yield evidence to better personalize dietary recommendations for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,R01 HL153178/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States R03 DK128386/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States T32 HL007024/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States ,Financial Disclosure: The authors declare that they have no relevant financial interests.,13.2,"Humans,Nutrition Assessment,Prospective Studies,Diet,Surveys and Questionnaires,Renal Insufficiency, Chronic,Observational Studies as Topic","D006801,D015596,D011446,D004032,D011795,D051436,D064887",2,2,"Journal Article,Review,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

Old donor organs accumulate senescent cells that have the capacity to induce senescence in naïve cells. We hypothesized that the engraftment of old organs may induce senescence in younger recipients, promoting age-related pathologies. When performing isogeneic cardiac transplants between age-mismatched C57BL/6 old donor (18 months) mice and young and middle-aged C57BL/6 (3- or 12- month-old) recipients , we observed augmented frequencies of senescent cells in draining lymph nodes, adipose tissue, livers, and hindlimb muscles 30 days after transplantation. These observations went along with compromised physical performance and impaired spatial learning and memory abilities. Systemic levels of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, including mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), were elevated in recipients. Of mechanistic relevance, injections of mt-DNA phenocopied effects of age-mismatched organ transplantation on accelerating aging. Single treatment of old donor animals with senolytics prior to transplantation attenuated mt-DNA release and improved physical capacities in young recipients. Collectively, we show that transplanting older organs induces senescence in transplant recipients, resulting in compromised physical and cognitive capacities. Depleting senescent cells with senolytics, in turn, represents a promising approach to improve outcomes of older organs.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,R01 AG064165/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States R33 AG061456/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States R37 AG013925/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States U01 AI132898/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States ,"Competing interests.

However, patients with advanced CKD, defined as eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or kidney disease treated with dialysis, have limitations to the use of some preferred glucose-lowering medications, are often treated with insulin, and experience high rates of severe hypoglycemia. Moreover, hemoglobin A1c accuracy decreases as GFR deteriorates. Hence, there is a need for better glycemic monitoring tools. Continuous glucose monitoring allows for 24-hour glycemic monitoring to understand patterns and the effects of lifestyle and medications. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring can be used to guide the administration of insulin and noninsulin therapies. Continuous glucose monitoring can overcome the limitations of self-monitored capillary glucose testing and hemoglobin A1c and has been shown to prevent hypoglycemic excursions in some populations. More data are needed to understand whether similar benefits can be obtained for patients with diabetes and advanced CKD. This review provides an updated approach to management of glycemia in advanced CKD, focusing on the role of continuous glucose monitoring in this high-risk population.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,K23 DK123384/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States R01 DK126373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States ,"R.J.

They demonstrate that in seven major placebo-controlled kidney outcome trials with different medications, treatment effect estimates on the HCE were consistently in similar directions and of similar magnitudes compared with treatment effects on the established kidney end point.

This impact is doubly felt in nephrology because obesity not only increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but also exacerbates existing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The role of medical weight loss therapy in CKD has been debated, but increasing evidence suggests that intentional weight loss is protective against adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. This may be particularly true with the advent of novel pharmacotherapies taking advantage of the incretin system, resulting in weight loss approaching that seen with surgical interventions. Moreover, these novel therapies have repeatedly demonstrated protective effects on the cardiovascular system.

Nevertheless, many patients die waiting for an organ and countless more never make it onto the waitlist because of a shortage of donor organs. Concurrently, thousands of donated organs are declined for transplant each year because of concerns about poor outcomes post-transplant. The decline of any donated organ-even if medically justified-is tragic for both the donor family and potential recipients. In this Personal Viewpoint, we discuss the need for a new mindset in how we honor the gift of organ donation. We believe that the use of transplant-declined human organs in translational research has the potential to hasten breakthrough discoveries in a multitude of scientific and medical areas. More importantly, such breakthroughs will allow us to properly value every donated organ. We further discuss the many practical challenges that such research presents and offer some possible solutions based on experiences in our own research laboratories.

Electronic address: mandy.ford@emory.edu.","Belatacept-based immunosuppression in kidney transplantation confers fewer off-target toxicities than calcineurin inhibitors but comes at a cost of increased incidence and severity of acute rejection, potentially due to its deleterious effect on both the number and function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs). TIGIT is a CD28 family coinhibitory receptor expressed on several subsets of immune cells including Tregs. We hypothesized that coinhibition through TIGIT signaling could function to ameliorate costimulation blockade-resistant rejection. The results demonstrate that treatment with an agonistic anti-TIGIT antibody, when combined with costimulation blockade by CTLA-4Ig, can prolong allograft survival in a murine skin graft model compared with CTLA-4Ig alone. Further, this prolongation of graft survival is accompanied by an increase in the frequency and number of graft-infiltrating Tregs and a concomitant reduction in the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the graft. Through the use of Treg-specific TIGIT conditional knockout animals, we demonstrated that the TIGIT-mediated reduction in the graft-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response is dependent on signaling of TIGIT on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Our results highlight both the key functional role of TIGIT on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs under conditions in which CTLA-4 is blocked and the therapeutic potential of TIGIT agonism to optimize costimulation blockade-based immunosuppression.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,R01 AI073707/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States F31 AI161911/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States R01 AI152516/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States R01 AI164716/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States R56 AI154895/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States T32 AI070081/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States ,"Disclosure.

Although kidney transplantation should be the preferred option in eligible patients, home hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) offer cost-effective options for KRT. In this review, the motivation for promoting home dialysis is presented, and the literature supporting it is critically reviewed. Randomized comparisons of home HD and PD with in-center HD have been challenging to conduct and provide only limited information. Nonrandomized studies are heterogeneous in their design and have often yielded conflicting results. They are prone to bias, and this must be carefully considered when evaluating this literature. Home modalities seem to have equivalent clinical outcomes and quality of life when compared with in-center HD. However, the cost of providing home therapies, particularly PD, is lower than conventional, in-center HD. Measures of home dialysis utilization, the philosophy behind their measurement, and important factors to consider when interpreting them are discussed. The importance of understanding measures of home dialysis utilization in the context of rates of kidney failure, the proportion of individuals who opt for conservative care, and rates of kidney transplantation is highlighted, and a framework for proposing targets is presented, using PD as an example.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,"R.R.

We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database (2006-2019) and developed the lung donor (LUNDON) acceptability score. A total of 83 219 brain-dead donors were included and were randomly divided into derivation (n = 58 314, 70%) and validation (n = 24 905, 30%) cohorts. The overall lung acceptance was 27.3% (n = 22 767). Donor factors associated with the lung acceptance were age, maximum creatinine, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, mechanism of death by asphyxiation or drowning, history of cigarette use (≥20 pack-years), history of myocardial infarction, chest x-ray appearance, bloodstream infection, and the occurrence of cardiac arrest after brain death. The prediction model had high discriminatory power (C statistic, 0.891; 95% confidence interval, 0.886-0.895) in the validation cohort. We developed a web-based, user-friendly tool (available at https://sites.wustl.edu/lundon) that provides the predicted probability of donor lung acceptance.

The authors evaluated performance of equations in an independent population of 4050 adults and evaluated other considerations important for implementation. They found that CKD-EPI and EKFC equations are approaching convergence, with better performance of eGFRcr-cys equations in the overall group and fewer differences among race, sex, and age subgroups than eGFRcr equations. Larger differences among eGFRcr equations reflect regional population differences in creatinine, forcing a trade-off between accuracy and uniformity in global implementation of eGFRcr equations.

Electronic address: yanhe6416@csu.edu.cn.","Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive drug that is widely used in the postsurgery management of transplantation. To date, the mechanism by which rapamycin reduces posttransplant neovascularization has not been fully understood. Given the original avascularity and immune privilege of the cornea, corneal transplantation is considered as an ideal model to investigate neovascularization and its effects on allograft rejection. Previously, we found that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) prolong corneal allograft survival through suppression of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Here, we show that depletion of MDSC abolished rapamycin-mediated suppression of neovascularization and elongation of corneal allograft survival. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that rapamycin dramatically enhanced the expression of arginase 1 (Arg1). Furthermore, an Arg1 inhibitor also completely abolished the rapamycin-mediated beneficial effects after corneal transplantation. Taken together, these findings indicate that MDSC and elevated Arg1 activity are essential for the immunosuppressive and antiangiogenic functions of rapamycin.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Yan He reports financial support was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China.

This process is dependent on pendrin and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) expressed in the apical membrane of β -ICs. The signal that leads to activation of this process was unknown. Plasma secretin levels increase during acute alkalosis, and the secretin receptor (SCTR) is functionally expressed in β -ICs. We find that mice with global knockout for the SCTR lose their ability to acutely increase renal base excretion. This forces the mice to lower their ventilation to cope with this challenge.

We present the case of a 66-year-old woman with diabetic kidney disease who underwent a protocol KPMP kidney biopsy. Her clinical history included diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy and eye disease, increased insulin resistance, hypertension, albuminuria, and relatively preserved glomerular filtration rate (early CKD stage 3a). The patient's histopathology was consistent with diabetic nephropathy and arterial and arteriolar sclerosis. Three-dimensional, immunofluorescence imaging of the kidney biopsy specimen revealed extensive peri-glomerular neovascularization that was underestimated by standard histopathologic approaches. Spatial transcriptomics was performed to obtain gene expression signatures at discrete areas of the kidney biopsy. Gene expression in the areas of glomerular neovascularization revealed increased expression of genes involved in angiogenic signaling, proliferation and survival of endothelial cells, as well as new vessel maturation and stability. This molecular correlation provides additional insights into the development of kidney disease in patients with diabetes and spotlights how novel molecular techniques employed by the KPMP can supplement and enrich the histopathologic diagnosis obtained from a kidney biopsy.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,U01DK114866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK114866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK114908/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133097/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133766/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133081/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK114933/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK114908/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133095/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK114907/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133097/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133768/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK114920/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK114933/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK114923/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U24DK114886/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133113/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133095/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133090/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133091/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK114920/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133768/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133092/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133081/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK114907/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK114923/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133091/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133093/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133093/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U24 DK114886/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133090/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01DK133113/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States U01 DK133766/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States ,"D.

B cell-depleting treatments are used to reduce anti-HLA antibodies but have limited efficacy. We hypothesized that the primary source for anti-HLA antibodies is long-lived plasma cells, which are ineffectively targeted by B cell depletion. To study this, we screened for anti-HLA antibodies in a prospectively enrolled cohort of 49 patients who received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CARTx), targeting naïve and memory B cells (CD19-targeted, n = 21) or plasma cells (BCMA-targeted, n = 28) for hematologic malignancies. Longitudinal samples were collected before and up to 1 year after CARTx. All individuals were in sustained remission. We identified 4 participants with anti-HLA antibodies before CD19-CARTx. Despite B cell depletion, anti-HLA antibodies and calculated panel reactive antibody scores were stable for 1 year after CD19-CARTx. Only 1 BCMA-CARTx recipient had pre-CARTx low-level anti-HLA antibodies, with no follow-up samples available. These data implicate CD19<sup>neg</sup> long-lived plasma cells as an important source for anti-HLA antibodies, a model supported by infrequent HLA sensitization in BCMA-CARTx subjects receiving previous plasma cell-targeted therapies. Thus, plasma cell-targeted therapies may be more effective against HLA antibodies, thereby enabling improved access to organ transplantation and rejection management.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,R01 AR073938/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States U01 CA247548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States ,,8.8,"Humans,Immunotherapy, Adoptive,B-Cell Maturation Antigen,Antigens, CD19,B-Lymphocytes,Hematologic Neoplasms","D006801,D016219,D053301,D018941,D001402,D019337",9,15,"Journal Article,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin K supplementation on the primary end point, serum calcification propensity (calciprotein particle maturation time, T50), and secondary end points arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and vitamin K status in 40 vitamin K-deficient KTRs (plasma dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein [dp-ucMGP] ≥500 pmol/L). Participants (35% female; age, 57 ± 13 years) were randomized 1:1 to vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7, 360 μg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Vitamin K supplementation had no effect on calcification propensity (change in T50 vs baseline +2.3 ± 27.4 minutes) compared with placebo (+0.8 ± 34.4 minutes; P<sub>between group</sub> = .88) but prevented progression of PWV (change vs baseline -0.06 ± 0.26 m/s) compared with placebo (+0.27 ± 0.43 m/s; P<sub>between group</sub> = .010). Vitamin K supplementation strongly improved vitamin K status (change in dp-ucMGP vs baseline -385 [-631 to -269] pmol/L) compared with placebo (+39 [-188 to +183] pmol/L; P<sub>between group</sub> < .001), although most patients remained vitamin K-deficient. In conclusion, vitamin K supplementation did not alter serum calcification propensity but prevented progression of arterial stiffness, suggesting that vitamin K has vascular effects independent of calciprotein particles. These results set the stage for longer-term intervention studies with vitamin K supplementation in KTRs.

However, emerging themes include the apparent diffusion coefficient derived from diffusion-weighted imaging, T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> mapping parameters, and cortical perfusion being consistently associated with kidney damage and predicting kidney function decline. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI has shown inconsistent associations with kidney damage markers but has been predictive of kidney function decline in several studies. Therefore, multiparametric MRI of the kidneys has the potential to address the limitations of existing diagnostic methods to provide a noninvasive, noncontrast, and radiation-free method to assess whole kidney structure and function.

In a pragmatic observational study of 692 patients, the authors found that among patients who initiated hemodialysis with a central vein catheter (CVC), a strategy that maximized AVF placement resulted in a higher frequency of access procedures and greater access management costs for patients who initially received an AVF than an AVG. A more selective policy that avoided AVF placement if an AVF was predicted to be at high risk of failure resulted in a lower frequency of access procedures and access costs in patients receiving an AVF versus an AVG.

The basolateral reabsorptive urate transporter GLUT9a appears to be the dominant target for insulin. By contrast, IGF-1 infusion reduces serum urate (SU), through mechanisms unknown. Genetic variants of IGF1R associated with reduced SU have increased IGF-1R expression and interact with genes encoding the GLUT9 and ABCG2 urate transporters, in a sex-specific fashion, which controls the SU level. Activation of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling in Xenopus oocytes modestly activates GLUT9a and inhibits insulin's stimulatory effect on the transporter, which also activates multiple secretory urate transporters-ABCG2, ABCC4, OAT1, and OAT3. The results collectively suggest that IGF-1 reduces SU by activating secretory urate transporters and inhibiting insulin's action on GLUT9a.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,P50 AR060772/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States ,"H.K.

Medline and EMBASE were searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant studies. The included articles reported varicella vaccine administration in the posttransplant period in children and adults. A pooled proportion of transplant recipients who seroconverted and who developed vaccine-strain varicella and varicella disease was generated. Eighteen articles (14 observational studies and 4 case reports) were included, reporting on 711 transplant recipients who received the varicella vaccine. The pooled proportion was 88.2% (95% confidence interval 78.0%-96.0%, 13 studies) for vaccinees who seroconverted, 0% (0%-1.2%, 13 studies) for vaccine-strain varicella, and 0.8% (0%-4.9%, 9 studies) for varicella disease. Most studies followed clinical guidelines for administering live-attenuated vaccines, with criteria that could include being at least 1 year posttransplant, 2 months postrejection episode, and on low-dose immunosuppressive medications. Varicella vaccination in transplant recipients was overall safe in the included studies, with few cases of vaccine-strain-induced varicella or vaccine failure, and although it was immunogenic, the proportion of recipients who seroconverted was lower than that seen in the general population. Our data support varicella vaccination in select pediatric solid organ transplant recipients.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,"Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: This study was supported by funding from The Hospital for Sick Children Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre (TRMC).

Dysfunctional Coupling of Cerebral Blood Flow and Susceptibility Value in the Bilateral Hippocampus is Associated with Cognitive Decline in Nondialysis Patients with CKD.,37476849,"Hao Wang,Xu Liu,Lijun Song,Wenbo Yang,Mingan Li,Qian Chen,Han Lv,Pengfei Zhao,Zhenghan Yang,Wenhu Liu,Zhen-Chang Wang","Department of Radiology , Beijing Friendship Hospital , Capital Medical University, Beijing , China.////Department of Nephrology , Beijing Friendship Hospital , Capital Medical University, Beijing , China.","Patients with end stage CKD often develop cognitive decline, but whether this is related to the underlying disease or to hemodialysis remains unclear. We performed three-dimensional pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling and quantitative susceptibility mapping prospectively in 40 patients with stage 1-4 CKD, 47 nondialysis patients with stage 5 CKD, and 44 healthy controls. Our magnetic resonance imaging data demonstrate that changes in cerebral blood flow-susceptibility coupling might underlie this cognitive decline, perhaps in the hippocampus and thalamus. These results suggest that magnetic resonance imaging parameters are potential biomarkers of cognitive decline in patients with CKD. Moreover, our findings may lead to discovery of novel therapeutic targets to prevent cognitive decline in patients with CKD.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,,All authors have nothing to disclose.,13.6,"Humans,Cerebrovascular Circulation,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Cognitive Dysfunction,Spin Labels,Hippocampus,Renal Insufficiency, Chronic,Iron","D006801,D002560,D008279,D060825,D013113,D006624,D051436,D007501",2,11,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

LCM/MS has played a crucial role in the identification of novel types of amyloidosis, biomarker discovery in fibrillary GN, and more recently discovery of novel target antigens in membranous nephropathy (MN). In addition, LCM/MS has also confirmed the role for complement proteins in glomerular diseases, including C3 glomerulopathy. LCM/MS is now widely used as a clinical test and considered the gold standard for diagnosis and typing amyloidosis. For the remaining glomerular diseases, LCM/MS has remained a research tool. In this review, we discuss the usefulness of LCM/MS in other glomerular diseases, particularly MN, deposition diseases, and diseases of complement pathways, and advocate more routine use of LCM/MS at the present time in at least certain diseases, such as MN, for target antigen detection. We also discuss the limitations of LCM/MS, particularly the difficulties faced from moving from a research-based technique to a clinical test. Nonetheless, the role of LCM/MS in glomerular diseases is expanding. Currently, LCM/MS may be used to identify the etiology in certain glomerular diseases, but in the future, LCM/MS can play a valuable role in determining pathways of complement activation, inflammation, and fibrosis.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States ,"L.M.P.

Macrophage M1-polarization is an important mechanism in AR development. MicroRNAs play vital roles in disease regulation; however, their effects on macrophages and AR remain unclear. In this study, rat models of AR were established following LT, and macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from rats and humans, respectively. We found miR-449a expression to be significantly reduced in macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Overexpression of miR-449a not only inhibited the M1-polarization of macrophages in vitro but also improved the AR of transplant in vivo. The mechanism involved inhibiting the noncanonical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathway. We identified procollagen-lysine1,2-oxoglutarate5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) as a target gene of miR-449a, which could reverse miR-449a's inhibition of macrophage M1-polarization, amelioration of AR, and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Overall, miR-449a inhibited the NF-κB pathway in macrophages through PLOD1 and also inhibited the M1-polarization of macrophages, thus attenuating AR after LT. In conclusion, miR-449a and PLOD1 may be new targets for the prevention and mitigation of AR.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Animals,Humans,Rats,Leukocytes, Mononuclear,Liver Transplantation,Macrophages,MicroRNAs,NF-kappa B,Procollagen","D000818,D006801,D051381,D007963,D016031,D008264,D035683,D016328,D011347",14,14,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Recurrent T cell and borderline rejections in a pediatric patient with high HEV copy numbers led us to study HEV infection within renal transplants. To investigate the frequency of renal HEV infection in transplanted patients, 15 samples from patients with contemporaneous diagnoses of HEV infection were identified at our center. Ten samples had sufficient residual paraffin tissue for immunofluorescence (IF) and RNA-fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (RNA-FISH). The biopsy of the pediatric index patient was additionally sufficient for tissue polymerase chain reaction and electron microscopy. HEV RNA was detected in paraffin tissue of the index patient by tissue polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, HEV infection was localized in tubular epithelial cells by IF, RNA-FISH, and electron microscopy. One additional biopsy from an adult was positive for HEV by RNA-FISH and IF. Focal IF positivity for HEV peptide was observed in 7 additional allografts. Ribavirin therapy was not successful in the pediatric index patient; after relapse, ribavirin is still administered. In the second patient, successful elimination of HEV was achieved after short-course ribavirin therapy.

However, understanding of ABMR has changed with the recognition that ABMR in kidney transplants is often donor-specific antibody (DSA)-negative and associated with natural killer (NK) cell transcripts. We therefore searched for a similar molecular ABMR-like state in transbronchial biopsies using gene expression microarray results from the INTERLUNG study (#NCT02812290). After optimizing rejection-selective transcript sets in a training set (N = 488), the resulting algorithms separated an NK cell-enriched molecular rejection-like state (NKRL) from T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR)/Mixed in a test set (N = 488). Applying this approach to all 896 transbronchial biopsies distinguished 3 groups: no rejection, TCMR/Mixed, and NKRL. Like TCMR/Mixed, NKRL had increased expression of all-rejection transcripts, but NKRL had increased expression of NK cell transcripts, whereas TCMR/Mixed had increased effector T cell and activated macrophage transcripts. NKRL was usually DSA-negative and not recognized as AMR clinically. TCMR/Mixed was associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction, reduced one-second forced expiratory volume at the time of biopsy, and short-term graft failure, but NKRL was not. Thus, some lung transplants manifest a molecular state similar to DSA-negative ABMR in kidney and heart transplants, but its clinical significance must be established.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,"Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: P F Halloran reports financial support was provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific.

These decisions do not typically include objective predictions regarding the future availability of equivalent or better-quality organs or the likelihood of patient death while waiting for another organ. To investigate the impact of displaying such predictions on organ donation decision making, we conducted a statistically designed experiment involving 53 kidney transplant professionals, in which kidney offers were presented via an online application and systematically altered to observe the effects on decision making. We found that providing predictive analytics for time-to-better offers and patient mortality improved decision consensus and decision-maker confidence in their decisions. Providing a visual display of the patient's mortality slope under accept/reject conditions shortened the time-to-decide but did not have an impact on the decision itself. Presenting the risk of death in a loss frame as opposed to a gain frame improved decision consensus and decision confidence. Patient-specific predictions surrounding future organ offers and mortality may improve decision quality, confidence, and expediency while improving organ utilization and patient outcomes.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Humans,Kidney,Tissue and Organ Procurement,Kidney Transplantation,Organ Transplantation,Consensus,Waiting Lists,Tissue Donors","D006801,D007668,D009927,D016030,D016377,D032921,D014850,D014019",4,8,"Journal Article,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."

This article details the iterative consensus-building process used by the American Society of Nephrology Quality Committee from May 2020 to July 2022 to develop the Optimal Care for Kidney Health MIPS Value Pathway (MVP). Two rounds of ranked-choice voting among Quality Committee members were used to select among nine quality metrics, 43 improvement activities, and three cost measures considered for inclusion in the MVP. Measure selection was iteratively refined in collaboration with the CMS MVP Development Team, and new MIPS measures were submitted through CMS's Measures Under Consideration process. The Optimal Care for Kidney Health MVP was published in the 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule and includes measures related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker use, hypertension control, readmissions, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and advance care planning.

Xenotransplantation holds promise as a treatment approach that could solve the supply problem. Major advances in gene-editing procedures have enabled several companies to raise genetically engineered pigs for organ donation. These porcine organs lack antigens and have other modifications that should reduce the probability of immunological rejection when transplanted into humans. The US Food and Drug Administration and transplantation leaders are starting to chart a path to test xenotransplants in clinical trials and later integrate them into routine clinical care. Here we provide a framework that industry, regulatory authorities, payers, transplantation professionals, and patient groups can implement to promote equity during every stage in this process. We also call for immediate action. Companies developing xenotransplant technology should assemble patient advocacy boards to bring the concerns of individuals with end-stage kidney disease to the forefront. For trials, xenotransplantation companies should partner with transplant programs with substantial patient populations of racial and ethnic minority groups and that have reciprocal relationships with those communities. Those companies and transplant programs should reach out now to those communities to inform them about xenotransplantation and try to address their concerns. These actions have the potential to make these communities full partners in the promise of xenotransplantation.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Animals,Humans,Animals, Genetically Modified,Kidney Failure, Chronic,Kidney Transplantation,Swine,Tissue and Organ Procurement,Transplantation, Heterologous,United States","D000818,D006801,D030801,D007676,D016030,D013552,D009927,D014183,D014481",3,3,"Journal Article,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

We aimed to validate a kidney allograft failure risk prediction system in a large international cohort of pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Patients from 20 centers in Europe and the United States, transplanted between 2004 and 2017, were included. Allograft assessment included estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, circulating antihuman leukocyte antigen donor-specific antibody, and kidney allograft histology. Individual predictions of allograft failure were calculated using the integrative box (iBox) system. Prediction performances were assessed using discrimination and calibration. The allograft evaluations were performed in 706 kidney transplant recipients at a median time of 9.1 (interquartile range, 3.3-19.2) months posttransplant; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 68.7 ± 28.1 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 0.1 (0.0-0.4) g/g, and 134 (19.0%) patients had antihuman leukocyte antigen donor-specific antibodies. The iBox exhibited accurate calibration and discrimination for predicting the outcomes up to 10 years after evaluation, with a C-index of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.87). This study confirms the generalizability of the iBox to predict long-term kidney allograft failure in children, with performances similar to those reported in adults.

However, an immunological correlate of protection has not been identified in this vulnerable population. We conducted a prospective monocentric cohort study of 65 kidney transplant recipients who received 3 doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Associations among breakthrough infection (BTI), vaccine responses, and patient characteristics were explored in 54 patients. Symptomatic COVID-19 was diagnosed in 32% of kidney transplant recipients during a period of 6 months after booster vaccination. During this period, SARS-CoV-2 delta and omicron were the dominant variants in the general population. Univariate Analyses identified the avidity of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain binding IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and SARS-CoV-2 S2-specific interferon gamma responses as correlates of protection against BTI. No demographic or clinical parameter correlated with the risk of BTI. In multivariate analysis, the risk of BTI was best predicted by neutralizing antibody and S2-specific interferon gamma responses. In conclusion, T cell responses may help compensate for the suboptimal antibody response to booster vaccination in kidney transplant recipients.

Using a large multinational cohort of 68,196 patients, we found that lower dialysate sodium concentrations (≤138 mmol/L) were independently associated with higher mortality compared with higher dialysate sodium concentrations (>138 mmol/L). The risk of death was lower among patients exposed to higher dialysate sodium concentrations, regardless of plasma sodium levels. These results challenge the prevailing assumption that lower dialysate sodium concentrations improve outcomes in hemodialysis patients.

We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 1156 consecutive lung transplants performed from 2010-2019. We used log-binomial regression to identify risk factors for infection and analyzed clinical management and outcomes. In total, 27 (2.3%) recipients developed mollicute infection. Donor characteristics independently associated with recipient infection were age ≤40 years (prevalence rate ratio [PRR] 2.6, 95% CI 1.0-6.9), White race (PRR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.8), and purulent secretions on donor bronchoscopy (PRR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.0). Median time to diagnosis was 16 days posttransplant (IQR: 11-26 days). Mollicute-infected recipients were significantly more likely to require prolonged ventilatory support (66.7% vs 21.4%), undergo dialysis (44.4% vs 6.3%), and remain hospitalized ≥30 days (70.4% vs 27.4%) after transplant. One-year posttransplant mortality in mollicute-infected recipients was 12/27 (44%), compared to 148/1129 (13%) in those without infection (P <.0001). Hyperammonemia syndrome occurred in 5/27 (19%) mollicute-infected recipients, of whom 3 (60%) died within 10 weeks posttransplant.

But the converse is also true: our treatment of kidney disease has an effect on the climate. Much attention has focused on how rising temperatures can lead to acute and CKD and health exacerbations in patients with established kidney disease. Climate change is also associated with rising air pollution from wildfires and industrial wastes and infectious diseases associated with flooding and changing habitats, all of which heighten the risk of acute and CKD. Less well recognized or understood are the ways nephrology practices, in turn, contribute to still more climate change. Hemodialysis, although lifesaving, can be associated with marked water usage (up to 600 L per dialysis session), energy usage (with one 4-hour session averaging as much as one fifth of the total energy consumed by a household per day), and large clinical wastes (with hemodialysis accounting for one third of total clinical medicine-associated waste). Of note, >90% of dialysis occurs in highly affluent countries, whereas dialysis is much less available in the poorer countries where climate change is having the highest effect on kidney disease. We conclude that not only do nephrologists need to prepare for the rise in climate-associated kidney disease, they must also urgently develop more climate-friendly methods of managing patients with kidney disease.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,R.J.

In this study, empagliflozin substantially decreased lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubule (PT) (a marker of proximal tubular sodium reabsorption), a magnitude out of proportion to that expected with only inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2. This finding was not driven by an ""osmotic diuretic"" effect; however, several parameters changed in a manner consistent with inhibition of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3. The large changes in proximal tubular handling were acutely buffered by increased reabsorption in both the loop of Henle and the distal nephron, resulting in the observed modest acute natriuresis with these agents. After 14 days of empagliflozin, natriuresis waned due to increased reabsorption in the PT and/or loop of Henle.

This study aimed to determine the degree of correlation among deprivation indices commonly used to characterize transplant populations. We used a retrospective cohort consisting of adults listed for liver or kidney transplants between 2008 and 2018 to compare 4 deprivation indices: neighborhood deprivation index, social deprivation index (SDI), area deprivation index, and social vulnerability index. Pairwise correlation between deprivation indices by transplant referral regions was measured using Spearman correlations of population-weighted medians and upper quartiles. In total, 52 individual variables were used among the 4 deprivation indices with 25% overlap. For both organs, the correlation between the population-weighted 75th percentile of the deprivation indices by transplant referral region was highest between SDI and social vulnerability index (liver and kidney, 0.93) and lowest between area deprivation index and SDI (liver, 0.19 and kidney, 0.15).

Among the 284 participants, osteoporosis and fracture were highly prevalent. Approximately 59% of participants had posttransplant osteopenia, and 35% of participants developed at least 1 fracture. Low BMD was associated with a polygenic osteoporosis risk score, and the interaction between genetic score and BMD predicted fracture. Pretransplant frailty was associated with risk for spine and hip fracture, which were not associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction or death. Chest fractures were the most frequent type of fracture and conferred a 2.2-fold increased risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction or death (time-dependent P < .001).

On June 25, 2021, a virtual multidisciplinary conference was convened to address sex-based disparities in transplantation. Common themes contributing to sex-based disparities were noted across kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplantation, specifically the existence of barriers to referral and wait listing for women, the pitfalls of using serum creatinine, the issue of donor/recipient size mismatch, approaches to frailty and a higher prevalence of allosensitization among women. In addition, actionable solutions to improve access to transplantation were identified, including alterations to the current allocation system, surgical interventions on donor organs, and the incorporation of objective frailty metrics into the evaluation process. Key knowledge gaps and high-priority areas for future investigation were also discussed.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Female,Humans,Frailty,Healthcare Disparities,Kidney,Organ Transplantation,Tissue and Organ Procurement,Tissue Donors,United States,Waiting Lists","D005260,D006801,D000073496,D054625,D007668,D016377,D009927,D014019,D014481,D014850",35,38,Congress

This exploratory analysis of the RESCUE clinical trial found that among patients with CKD stage 3-5 and systemic inflammation, ziltivekimab treatment significantly increased hemoglobin (Hb) levels after 12 weeks compared with placebo. Ziltivekimab was also associated with significant increases in serum iron levels, total iron-binding capacity, and transferrin saturation. No major safety concerns were reported.

Although high blood glucose elicits abnormal alterations in MCs, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We show that YAP/TAZ are increased in MCs of patients with DN and two animal models of DN. High glucose directly induces activation of YAP/TAZ through the canonical Hippo pathway in cultured MCs. Hyperactivation of YAP/TAZ in mouse MCs recapitulates the hallmarks of DN. Activated YAP/TAZ bind and stabilize N-Myc, one of the Myc family. N-Myc stabilization leads to aberrant enhancement of its transcriptional activity and to MC impairments.

Belatacept and abatacept are nondepleting fusion proteins blocking CD28/B7 costimulation, whereas siplizumab is a depleting antiCD2 immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody targeting CD2/CD58 costimulation. Herein, the effect of siplizumab combination therapy with abatacept or belatacept on T cell alloreactivity in mixed lymphocyte reactions was investigated. In contrast to monotherapy, the combination of siplizumab with belatacept or abatacept induced near-complete suppression of T cell proliferation and increased the potency of siplizumab-mediated T cell inhibition. Furthermore, dual targeting of CD2 and CD28 costimulation enhanced the selective depletion of memory T cells compared with monotherapy. Although siplizumab monotherapy leads to significant regulatory T cell enrichment, high doses of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and a human IgG1 Fc fragment in the combination therapy reduced this effect. These results support the clinical evaluation of dual costimulation blockade, combining siplizumab with abatacept or belatacept, for the prophylaxis of organ transplant rejection and improvement of long-term outcomes following transplantation. Ongoing investigative research will elucidate when other forms of siplizumab-based dual costimulatory blockade may be able to induce similarly strong inhibition of T cell activation although still allowing for enrichment of regulatory T cells.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,"Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: David Berglund reports financial support was provided by ITB-MED.

Such events typically occur late in the disease course, resulting in large trials in which most participants do not contribute clinical events. In addition, components of the end point are considered of equal importance; however, their clinical significance varies. For example, kidney function replacement therapy initiation is likely to be clinically more meaningful than GFR decline of ≥50%. By contrast, hierarchical composite end points (HCEs) combine multiple outcomes and prioritize each patient's most clinically relevant outcome for inclusion in analysis. In this review, we consider the use of HCEs in clinical trials of CKD progression, emphasizing the potential to combine dichotomous clinical events such as those typically used in CKD progression trials, with the continuous variable of GFR over time, while ranking all components according to clinical significance. We consider maraca plots to visualize overall treatment effects and the contributions of individual components, discuss the application of win odds in kidney HCE trials, and review general design considerations for clinical trials for CKD progression with kidney HCE as an efficacy end point.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,//AstraZeneca/ ,"M.

Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics (including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes) of 3,218 adults aged ≥60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022-June 2023. Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged ≥75 years, and the most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%-21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged ≥60 years.

A putatively unique syndrome, the cardiorenal syndrome, distinguishing five subtypes on the basis of the chronology of cardiac and kidney events, has been widely adopted. This review discusses the methodologic and practical problems inherent to the current classification of cardiorenal syndrome. The term ""disorder"" is more appropriate than the term ""syndrome"" to describe concomitant cardiovascular and kidney dysfunction and/or damage. Indeed, the term disorder designates a disruption induced by disease states to the normal function of organs or organ systems. We apply Occam's razor to the chronology-based construct to arrive at a simple definition on the basis of the coexistence of cardiovascular disease and CKD, the chronic cardiovascular-kidney disorder (CCKD). This conceptual framework builds upon the fact that cardiovascular and CKD share common risk factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms. Biological changes set in motion by kidney dysfunction accelerate cardiovascular disease progression and vice versa . Depending on various combinations of risk factors and precipitating conditions, patients with CCKD may present initially with cardiovascular disease or with hallmarks of CKD. Treatment targeting cardiovascular or kidney dysfunction may improve the outcomes of both. The portfolio of interventions targeting the kidney-cardiovascular continuum is in an expanding phase. In the medium term, applying the new omics sciences may unravel new therapeutic targets and further improve the therapy of CCKD. Trials based on cardiovascular and kidney composite end points are an attractive and growing area.

The VITALE (VITamin D supplementation in renAL transplant recipients) study is a multicenter double-blind randomized trial, including nondiabetic adult renal transplant recipients with serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH) vitamin D) levels of <30 ng/mL, which is randomized 12 to 48 months after transplantation to receive high (100 000 IU) or low doses (12 000 IU) of cholecalciferol every 2 weeks for 2 months and then monthly for 22 months. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint, including diabetes mellitus, major cardiovascular events, cancer, and death. Of 536 inclusions (50.8 [13.7] years, 335 men), 269 and 267 inclusions were in the high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively. The serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels increased by 23 versus 6 ng/mL in the high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively (P < .0001). In the intent-to-treat analysis, 15% versus 16% of the patients in the high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively, experienced a first event of the composite endpoint (hazard ratio, 0.94 [0.60-1.48]; P = .78), whereas 1% and 4% of patients in the high-dose and low-dose groups, respectively, experienced an incident symptomatic fracture (odds ratio, 0.24 [0.07-0.86], P = .03). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the groups.

In adjusted analyses, larger glomerular volume in the middle and deep cortex predicted progressive kidney disease.

The risk of complications, such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, in high viral load (HVL) carriers is the highest in heart Tx recipients. However, the immunologic signatures of such a risk have been insufficiently defined. Here, we assessed the phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including EBV-specific T cells, in 77 pediatric heart, kidney, and liver Tx recipients and established the relationship between memory differentiation and progression toward exhaustion. Unlike kidney and liver HVL carriers, heart HVL carriers displayed distinct CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with (1) up-regulation of interleukin-21R, (2) decreased naive phenotype and altered memory differentiation, (3) accumulation of terminally exhausted (T<sub>EX</sub> PD-1<sup>+</sup>T-bet<sup>-</sup>Eomes<sup>+</sup>) and decrease of functional precursors of exhausted (T<sub>PEX</sub> PD-1<sup>int</sup>T-bet<sup>+</sup>) effector subsets, and (4) transcriptomic signatures supporting the phenotypic changes. In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from heart HVL carriers displayed similar changes in naive and memory subsets, elevated Th1 follicular helper cells, and plasma interleukin-21, suggesting an alternative inflammatory mechanism that governs T cell responses in heart Tx recipients. These results may explain the different incidences of EBV complications and may help improve the risk stratification and clinical management of different types of Tx recipients.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,"Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Michael Green Consultant ITB-MED : DSMB member for siplizumab for induction in adult KTx Consultant for BMS: DSMB member for belatacept as rescue therapy in adolescent KTx recipients Member Adjudication committee for Allovir: assessment of response to CTL therapy for Adenovirus infection in pediatric stem cell transplant recipients.

Intermittent hemodialysis is usually provided 3 days per week in this setting on the basis that no clinical benefits have been demonstrated with more frequent hemodialysis. This should not detract from the importance of continually assessing and refining the hemodialysis prescription (including the need for extra treatments) according to dynamic changes in extracellular volume and other parameters, and ensuring that an adequate dose of hemodialysis is being delivered to the patient. Compared with other KRT modalities, the cardinal challenge encountered during intermittent hemodialysis is hemodynamic instability. This phenomenon occurs when reductions in intravascular volume, as a consequence of ultrafiltration and/or osmotic shifts, outpace compensatory plasma refilling from the extravascular space. Myocardial stunning, triggered by intermittent hemodialysis, and independent of ultrafiltration, may also contribute. The hemodynamic effect of intermittent hemodialysis is likely magnified in patients who are critically ill due to an inability to mount sufficient compensatory physiologic responses in the context of multiorgan dysfunction. Of the many interventions that have undergone testing to mitigate hemodynamic instability related to KRT, the best evidence exists for cooling the dialysate and raising the dialysate sodium concentration. Unfortunately, the evidence supporting routine use of these and other interventions is weak owing to poor study quality and limited sample sizes. Intermittent hemodialysis will continue to be an important and commonly used KRT modality for AKI in patients with critical illness, especially in jurisdictions where resources are limited. There is an urgent need to harmonize the definition of hemodynamic instability related to KRT in clinical trials and robustly test strategies to combat it in this vulnerable patient population.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,E.G.

The United Network for Organ Sharing has recently come under scrutiny, prompting a review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine as summarized in its recent report and also by the US Senate Finance Committee. The national news services have opined about organ donation ethics, access to transplantation particularly for medically underserved populations, and management of organ transplantation data. These critiques raise important concerns that deserve our best response as a transplant community. Broadly, we suggest that the data management approach of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network be replaced with a patient-centric omnichannel network in which all donor and recipient data exist in a single longitudinal record that can be used by all applications. A more comprehensive and standardized approach to donor data collection would drive quality improvement across organ procurement organizations and help address inequities in transplantation. Finally, a substantial increase in organ donation would be prompted by considering organ donors as a public health resource, meriting transparent publicly available data collection with respect to organ donor referral, screening, and management.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Humans,United States,Tissue Donors,Organ Transplantation,Tissue and Organ Procurement,Transplants,United States Health Resources and Services Administration","D006801,D014481,D014019,D016377,D009927,D019737,D014488",2,2,Journal Article

Causative features include fat malabsorption and/or increased intestinal permeability to oxalate. Enteric hyperoxaluria has long been known to cause nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, and, more recently, an association with CKD and kidney failure has been shown. Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for enteric hyperoxaluria, and it is unclear what end points should be used to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs and biologics for this condition. This study represents work of a multidisciplinary group convened by the Kidney Health Initiative to review the evidence supporting potential end points for clinical trials in enteric hyperoxaluria. A potential clinical outcome is symptomatic kidney stone events. Potential surrogate end points include ( 1 ) an irreversible loss of kidney function as a surrogate for progression to kidney failure, ( 2 ) asymptomatic kidney stone growth/new stone formation observed on imaging as a surrogate for symptomatic kidney stone events, ( 3 ) urinary oxalate and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation as surrogates for the development of symptomatic kidney stone events, and ( 4) plasma oxalate as a surrogate for the development of the clinical manifestations of systemic oxalosis.

We modeled the LDR as a continuous variable and obtained adjusted LDR estimates for each TRR, accounting for clinical and demographic characteristics of ESLD decedents, socioeconomic and health care environment within the TRR, and characteristics of the transplant environment. The overall mean LDR was 0.24 (range: 0.10-0.53). In the final model, proportion of patients living in poverty and concentrated poverty was negatively associated with LDR; organ donation rate was positively associated with LDR. The R<sup>2</sup> was 0.60, indicating that 60% of the variability in LDR was explained by the model.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those receiving dialysis, may be at increased risk of developing vitamin deficiencies due to anorexia, poor dietary intake, protein energy wasting, restricted diet, dialysis loss, or inadequate sun exposure for vitamin D. However, clinical manifestations of most vitamin deficiencies are usually subtle or undetected in this population. Testing for circulating levels is not undertaken for most vitamins except folate, B<sub>12</sub>, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D because assays may not be available or may be costly to perform and do not always correlate with body stores. The last systematic review through 2016 was performed for the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2020 Nutrition Guideline update, so this article summarizes the more recent evidence. We review the use of vitamins supplementation in the CKD population. To date there have been no randomized trials to support the benefits of any vitamin supplementation for kidney, cardiovascular, or patient-centered outcomes. The decision to supplement water-soluble vitamins should be individualized, taking account the patient's dietary intake, nutritional status, risk of vitamins deficiency/insufficiency, CKD stage, comorbid status, and dialysis loss. Nutritional vitamin D deficiency should be corrected, but the supplementation dose and formulation need to be personalized, taking into consideration the degree of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, parathyroid hormone levels, CKD stage, and local formulation. Routine supplementation of vitamins A and E is not supported due to potential toxicity. Although more trial data are required to elucidate the roles of vitamin supplementation, all patients with CKD should undergo periodic assessment of dietary intake and aim to receive various vitamins through natural food sources and a healthy eating pattern that includes vitamin-dense foods.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Vitamins,Vitamin D,Dietary Supplements,Renal Insufficiency, Chronic,Vitamin D Deficiency,Vitamin A,Avitaminosis,Vitamin K","D006801,D014815,D014807,D019587,D051436,D014808,D014801,D001361,D014812",5,6,"Journal Article,Review"

Key points from the workshop and recommendations for intervention and research are highlighted. Facilitators of program success included prioritizing trust-building with participants, enabling participants to determine what aspects of the intervention were needed, providing participants with tools to help themselves and others after the intervention, and taking a trauma-informed approach to relationships.

We used the Optum deidentified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset to identify individuals with CKD stages 4 or 5 who transitioned to dialysis. We searched structured data elements from clinical notes, identified by natural language processing, for symptoms recorded across weekly intervals in the 6 months before and after dialysis initiation and estimated changes in the odds of a symptom being recorded with an interrupted time series analysis using segmented logistic regression. The cohort comprised 728 individuals (aged 68±13 years, 44% women, 56% White, 30% Black). Before dialysis initiation, 83% were recorded as having pain, 68% fatigue/weakness, 66% shortness of breath, 61% nausea/vomiting, and 37% difficulty concentrating. Before dialysis initiation, odds of pain being recorded increased (slope: odds ratio [OR] 1.02 per week, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.03); initiation was associated with a decrease (intercept change: OR 0.70, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82). After initiation, odds of pain were unchanged (postdialysis slope: OR 1.00 per week, 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.01), although this represented an improved trajectory relative to the predialysis period (change in slope: OR 0.98 per week, 95% CI, 0.96 to 0.99). For fatigue/weakness, odds increased before initiation (OR 1.03 per week, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.04) but decreased on initiation (OR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.75) and thereafter (OR 0.98 per week, 95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99), representing a reduction in slope (OR 0.95 per week, 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.97). Patterns for shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and difficulty concentrating were similar to those of pain.

These disorders often involve cilia-related genes and lead to the development of fluid-filled cysts and eventual kidney function decline and failure. Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic (PGT-M) disorders has moved into the clinical realm. It allows prospective parents to avoid passing on heritable diseases to their children, including monogenic PKD. The PGT-M process involves embryo generation through in vitro fertilization, with subsequent testing of embryos and selective transfer of those that do not harbor the specific disease-causing variant(s). There is a growing body of literature supporting the success of PGT-M for autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive PKD, although with important technical limitations in some cases. This technology can be applied to many other types of monogenic PKD and ciliopathies despite the lack of existing reports in the literature. PGT-M for monogenic PKD, like other forms of assisted reproductive technology, raises important ethical questions. When considering PGT-M for kidney diseases, as well as the potential to avoid disease in future generations, there are regulatory and ethical considerations. These include limited government regulation and unstandardized consent processes, potential technical errors, high cost and equity concerns, risks associated with pregnancy for mothers with kidney disease, and the impact on all involved in the process, including the children who were made possible with this technology.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,R01 DK058816/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States ,"S.N.

Preventing SFSS involves consideration of factors before the surgical procedure, including donor and recipient selection, and factors during the surgical procedure, including adequate outflow reconstruction, graft portal inflow modulation, and management of portosystemic shunts. International Liver Transplantation Society, International Living Donor Liver Transplantation Group, and Liver Transplant Society of India Consensus Conference was convened in January 2023 to develop recommendations for the prediction and management of SFSS in LDLT. The format of the conference was based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. International experts in this field were allocated to 4 working groups (diagnosis, prevention, anesthesia, and critical care considerations, and management of established SFSS). The working groups prepared evidence-based recommendations to answer-specific questions considering the currently available literature. The working group members, independent panel, and conference attendees served as jury to edit and confirm the final recommendations presented at the end of the conference by each working group separately.

Calibration is rarely assessed in clinical prediction models, yet it is a key factor in determining access to lung transplant. We assessed the calibration of the WL-lung allocation score (LAS)/CAS models and developed alternative models to minimize miscalibration. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data from 2015 to 2020 were used to assess the calibration of the WL model and for subgroups (age, sex, diagnosis, and race/ethnicity). Three recalibrated models were developed and compared: (1) simple recalibration model (SRM), (2) weighted recalibration model 1 (WRM1), and (3) weighted recalibration model 2 (WRM2). The current WL-LAS/CAS model underestimated risk for 78% of individuals (predicted mortality risk, <42%) and overpredicted risk for 22% of individuals (predicted mortality risk, ≥42%), with divergent results among subgroups. Error measures improved in SRM, WRM1, and WRM2. SRM generally preserved candidate rankings, whereas WRM1 and WRM2 led to changes in ranking by age and diagnosis. Differential miscalibration occurred in the WL-LAS/CAS model, which improved with recalibration measures. Further inquiry is needed to develop mortality models in which risk predictions approximate observed data to ensure accurate ranking and timely access to transplant. IMPACT: With changes to the lung transplant allocation system planned in 2023, evaluation of the accuracy and precision of survival models used to rank candidates for lung transplant is important. The waitlist model underpredicts risk for 78% of US transplant candidates with an unequal distribution of miscalibration across subgroups leading to inaccurate ranking of transplant candidates.

To prevent thromboembolic complications, an immunoglobulin G4 anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody, TNX-1500, which retains the fragment antigen binding region of ruplizumab (humanized 5c8, BG9588), was modified by protein engineering to decrease Fc binding to Fc-gamma receptor IIa while retaining certain other effector functions and pharmacokinetics comparable with natural antibodies.

Histological analysis of graft biopsy is still the gold standard for evaluation of allograft injury, but it is an invasive procedure and prone to sampling errors. The past decade has seen an increased number of efforts to develop minimally invasive procedures for monitoring allograft injury. Despite the recent progress, limitations such as the complexity of proteomics-based technology, the lack of standardization, and the heterogeneity of populations that have been included in different studies have hindered proteomic tools from reaching clinical transplantation. This review focuses on the role of proteomics-based platforms in biomarker discovery and validation in solid organ transplantation. We also emphasize the value of biomarkers that provide potential mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of allograft injury, dysfunction, or rejection.

Transplantation from a donor with a better Living Donor Kidney Profile Index (LKDPI) may encourage CP participation in KPD programs. We undertook parallel analyses using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry to determine whether the LKDPI discriminates death-censored graft survival (DCGS) between LDs. Discrimination was assessed by the following: (1) the change in the Harrell C statistic with the sequential addition of variables in the LKDPI equation to reference models that included only recipient factors and (2) whether the LKDPI discriminated DCGS among pairs of prognosis-matched LD recipients. The addition of the LKDPI to reference models based on recipient variables increased the C statistic by only 0.02. Among prognosis-matched pairs, the C statistic in Cox models to determine the association of the LKDPI with DCGS was no better than chance alone (0.51 in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient and 0.54 in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry cohorts).

We used data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network on all kidney donors and recipients of kidney transplants from January 1, 2015, to March 31, 2022 to evaluate temporal changes using joinpoint regression. Our primary analyses compared donors on the basis of their HCV viremic status (HCV-infected vs HCV-negative).

There was a statistically significant decrease in the discard rates of HCV-infected kidney donors from 40% to just over 20% over a 1-year period, with a concurrent increase in kidneys transplanted per donor. This increased utilization occurred in tandem with the publication of pilot trials involving HCV-infected kidney donors in HCV-negative recipients rather than an increase in the donor pool.

Patients with AKI, including those who require KRT, experience multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic perturbations that dynamically influence medication effectiveness and safety. Patients with AKI may experience both subtherapeutic drug concentrations, which lead to ineffective therapy, and supratherapeutic drug concentrations, which increase the risk for toxicity. In critically ill patients with AKI not requiring KRT, conventional GFR estimation equations, especially those based on serum creatinine, have several limitations that can limit the accuracy when used for medication dosing. Alternative methods to estimate kidney function may be informative, including use of measured urinary creatinine clearance, kinetic eGFR, and equations that integrate novel kidney biomarkers. For critically ill patients with AKI requiring KRT, physicochemical properties of the drug, the KRT prescription and circuit configuration, and patient-specific factors each contribute to medication clearance. Evidence-based guidance for medication dosing during AKI requiring KRT is often limited. A working knowledge of the basic tenets of drug elimination during KRT can provide a framework for how to approach decision making when the literature is lacking.

Limited specific data are available on the zoonotic potential of pig pathogens. It is anticipated that the risk of zoonotic infection in xenograft recipients will be determined by organisms present in source animals and relate to the nature and intensity of the immunosuppression used to maintain xenograft function. Based on experience in allotransplantation and with preclinical models, viral infections are of greatest concern, including porcine cytomegalovirus, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus, and porcine endogenous retroviruses. Sensitive and specific microbiological assays are required for routine microbiological surveillance of source animals and xenograft recipients. Archiving of blood samples from recipients, contacts, and hospital staff may provide a basis for microbiological investigations if infectious syndromes develop. Carefully implemented infection control practices are required to prevent zoonotic pathogen exposures by clinical care providers. Informed consent practices for recipients and their close contacts must convey the lack of specific data for infectious risk assessment. Available data suggest that infectious risks of xenotransplantation are manageable and that clinical trials can advance with carefully developed protocols for pretransplant assessment, syndrome evaluation, and microbiological monitoring.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,"Conflicts of interest Dr. Fishman serves on the scientific advisory boards of Jura Bio, Well Medical Inc. , Sfunga Inc. , and as a consultant to eGenesis Inc and Makana Inc.

Hence, specific curative approaches for rare kidney diseases are scarce, and these diseases are not treated optimally, with implications on the patients' health and quality of life, on the cost for the health care system, and society. There is therefore a need for rare kidney diseases and their mechanisms to receive the appropriate scientific, political, and policy attention to develop specific corrective approaches. A wide range of policies are required to address the various challenges that target care for rare kidney diseases, including the need to increase awareness, improve and accelerate diagnosis, support and implement therapeutic advances, and inform the management of the diseases. In this article, we provide specific policy recommendations to address the challenges hindering the provision of targeted care for rare kidney diseases, focusing on awareness and prioritization, diagnosis, management, and therapeutic innovation. In combination, the recommendations provide a holistic approach aiming for all aspects of rare kidney disease care to improve health outcomes, reduce the economic effect, and deliver benefits to society.

This study evaluated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system post-kidney xenotransplantation. Kidneys from genetically-engineered pigs were transplanted into 5 immunosuppressed baboons after the excision of the native kidneys. Immunosuppressive therapy was based on the blockade of the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway. Plasma renin, angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone levels, and urine osmolality and electrolytes were measured in healthy pigs, healthy nonimmunosuppressed baboons, and immunosuppressed baboons with life-supporting pig kidney grafts. After pig kidney transplantation, plasma renin and Ang II levels were not significantly different, although Ang II trended lower, even though plasma AGT and potassium were increased. Plasma aldosterone levels were unchanged. Urine osmolality and sodium concentration were decreased. Even in the presence of increasing AGT and potassium levels, lower plasma Ang II concentrations may be because of reduced, albeit not absent, the reactivity of pig renin to cleave baboon AGT, suggesting an impaired response of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to hypovolemic and hypotensive episodes. The maintenance of aldosterone may be protective. The reduced urine osmolality and sodium concentration reflect the decreased ability of the pig kidney to concentrate urine.

Complement activation has emerged as a key driver of glomerular injury in IgAN. Therefore, complement inhibitors may be a rational treatment option in patients unresponsive to first-line immunosuppressive therapy. Here, we describe the case of a 24-year-old woman presenting with crescentic IgAN recurrence a few months after living kidney transplantation. Considering the dramatic graft failure accompanied by malignant hypertension and thrombotic microangiopathy features worsening after a first-line of high-dose steroids and 3 sessions of plasma exchanges, eculizumab was started as a rescue therapy. For the first time, the clinical response to eculizumab was highly successful, with a complete graft recovery without any relapse after 1 year of treatment.

In organ transplantation, it has been known that mixed chimerism using donor-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) can induce donor-specific tolerance. However, it is unclear whether iPSC-derived HSPCs (iHSPCs) can induce allograft tolerance. We showed that 2 hematopoietic transcription factors, Hoxb4 and Lhx2, can efficiently expand iHSPCs with a c-Kit<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Lineage<sup>-</sup> phenotype, which possesses long-term hematopoietic repopulating potential. We also demonstrated that these iHSPCs can form hematopoietic chimeras in allogeneic recipients and induce allograft tolerance in murine skin and iPSC transplantation.

An anti-ATG immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune response was elicited in all patients within 14 days. In turn, the elimination of total and Treg-specific ATG was accelerated substantially over control patients receiving the same dose of ATG with concomitant immunosuppression. However, ATG serum concentrations of <1 μg/mL, which had previously been reported as subtherapeutic threshold, triggered apoptosis of Tregs in vitro. Therefore, ATG levels need to decline to lower levels than those previously thought for efficacious Treg transfer.

There has been an upsurge of prognostic research in the field of nephrology, but the uptake of prognostic models in clinical practice remains limited. Therefore, we map out the research field of prognostic models for kidney patients and provide directions on how to proceed from here. We performed a scoping review of studies developing, validating, or updating a prognostic model for patients with CKD. We searched all published models in PubMed and Embase and report predicted outcomes, methodological quality, and validation and/or updating efforts. We found 602 studies, of which 30.1% concerned CKD populations, 31.6% dialysis populations, and 38.4% kidney transplantation populations. The most frequently predicted outcomes were mortality ( n =129), kidney disease progression ( n =75), and kidney graft survival ( n =54). Most studies provided discrimination measures (80.4%), but much less showed calibration results (43.4%). Of the 415 development studies, 28.0% did not perform any validation and 57.6% performed only internal validation. Moreover, only 111 models (26.7%) were externally validated either in the development study itself or in an independent external validation study. Finally, in 45.8% of development studies no useable version of the model was reported. To conclude, many prognostic models have been developed for patients with CKD, mainly for outcomes related to kidney disease progression and patient/graft survival.

Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) plays a key role in the modulation of these pathways. This study assesses the impact of the HLA-G genotype on immunologic risk and survival following LTx. This retrospective cohort study included 289 bilateral LTx. Recipient and donor HLA-G genotypes were analyzed to identify associations with de novo donor-specific antibodies, acute rejection, chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and allograft survival. We further assessed these associations, both individually and in paired analysis, based on a grouped haplotype classification of HLA-G expression. Donor HLA-G single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with allograft injury, the onset of chronic lung allograft dysfunction following injury, and allograft survival. Recipient HLA-G single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with allograft injury, cellular rejection, and donor-specific antibody formation. ""Low HLA-G expression"" donor haplotypes were associated with impaired allograft survival, as were ""low HLA-G expression"" donor-recipient haplotype pairs. This study provides compelling evidence for the role of HLA-G in modulating immunologic risk after LTx.

Using a pretest-posttest design, the strategy included an 8-week multicomponent training on bias reduction, standardized numerical social assessments, and enhanced group dynamics at an AHF center. Evaluations of organizational and cultural changes included pretest-posttest AHF team member surveys, transcripts of AHF meetings to assess group dynamics using a standardized scoring system, and posttest interviews guided by a framework for implementing a complex strategy. Results were analyzed with qualitative descriptive methods and Brunner-Munzel tests for relative effect (RE, RE >0.5 signals posttest improvement). The majority of survey metrics revealed potential benefit with RE >0.5. REs were >0.5 for 5 of 6 group dynamics metrics. Themes for implementation included (1) promoting equitable distribution of scarce resources, (2) requiring a change in team members' time investment to correct bias and change the meeting structure, (3) slowing and then accelerating the allocation process, and (4) adaptable beyond AHF and reinforceable with semi-annual trainings.

If differences in body composition explain differences in serum concentration by race or ethnicity, then estimates of body composition could be used in eGFR equations rather than race.

In this national study of 58,264 single-kidney transplant recipients, statin use was associated with a 5% decrease in mortality. More importantly, this protective association was stronger among those who used a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor for immunosuppression (27% decrease in mTOR inhibitor users versus 5% in nonusers).

Recipients received a modified immunosuppression regimen, without induction therapy, consisting of maintenance tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. Steroids were weaned off over 14 weeks. No rejection was seen on any protocol biopsy. Therefore, all patients discontinued mycophenolate mofetil 11 to 13 months posttransplant, per protocol. An early for-cause biopsy in 1 patient, 5 days after dar-Treg infusion, revealed absence of rejection and accumulation of Tregs in the kidney allograft. All patients had Treg-containing lymphoid aggregates evident on protocol biopsies performed 8 months posttransplant. The patients are now all >6 years posttransplant on tacrolimus monotherapy with excellent graft function. None experienced rejection episodes.

Proteomic analysis of uEVs identified matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) as a biomarker predictive of rapid disease progression. In validation studies, MMP-7 was predictive in uEVs but not in whole urine, possibly because uEVs are primarily secreted by tubular epithelial cells. Indeed, single-nucleus RNA sequencing showed that MMP-7 was especially increased in proximal tubule and thick ascending limb cells, which were further characterized by a profibrotic phenotype.

SOTRs and other immunosuppressed patients have been routinely excluded from ICI clinical trials with good reason: immune checkpoints play an important role in self- and allograft-tolerance and risk of acute allograft rejection reported in retrospective studies affects 10% to 65% of cases. These reports also confirm that cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma respond to ICI therapy, although response rates are generally lower than those observed in immunocompetent populations. Prospective trials are now of critical importance in further establishing ICI efficacy and safety. However, based on current knowledge, we recommend that ICIs should be offered to kidney transplant recipients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma if surgery and/or radiotherapy have failed. For kidney transplant recipients, this should be first line ahead of chemotherapy and targeted therapies. In SOTRs, the use of ICIs should be carefully considered with the benefits of ICIs versus risks of allograft rejection weighed up on a case-by-case basis as part of shared decision-making with patients. In all cases, parallel management of immunosuppression may be key to ICI responsiveness. We recommend maintaining immunosuppression before ICI initiation with a dual immunosuppressive regimen combining mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and either corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Such modification of immunosuppression must be considered in the context of allograft risk (both rejection and also its subsequent treatment) and risk of tumor progression. Ultimately, a multidisciplinary approach should underpin all clinical decision-making in this challenging scenario.",Transplantation,,,6.2,"Humans,Skin Neoplasms,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,Retrospective Studies,Prospective Studies,Melanoma,Organ Transplantation,Transplant Recipients","D006801,D012878,D002294,D000082082,D012189,D011446,D008545,D016377,D066027",12,13,Journal Article

Electronic address: bostjan.humar@usz.ch.","Surgical liver failure (SLF) develops when a marginal amount of hepatic mass is left after surgery, such as following excessive resection. SLF is the commonest cause of death due to liver surgery; however, its etiology remains obscure. Using mouse models of standard hepatectomy (sHx) (68%, resulting in full regeneration) or extended hepatectomy (eHx) (86%/91%, causing SLF), we explored the causes of early SLF related to portal hyperafflux. Assessing the levels of HIF2A with or without oxygenating agent inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) indicated hypoxia early after eHx. Subsequently, lipid oxidation (PPARA/PGC1α) was downregulated and associated with persisting steatosis. Mild oxidation with low-dose ITPP reduced the levels of HIF2A, restored downstream PPARA/PGC1α expression along with lipid oxidation activities (LOAs), and normalized steatosis and other metabolic or regenerative SLF deficiencies. Promotion of LOA with L-carnitine likewise normalized the SLF phenotype, and both ITPP and L-carnitine markedly raised survival in lethal SLF. In patients who underwent hepatectomy, pronounced increases in serum carnitine levels (reflecting LOA) were associated with better recovery. Lipid oxidation thus provides a link between the hyperafflux of O<sub>2</sub>-poor portal blood, the metabolic/regenerative deficits, and the increased mortality typifying SLF. Stimulation of lipid oxidation-the prime regenerative energy source-particularly through L-carnitine may offer a safe and feasible way to reduce SLF risks in the clinic.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Mice,Animals,Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha,Liver,Liver Failure,Hepatectomy,Liver Regeneration,Hypoxia,Carnitine,Lipids","D051379,D000818,D000071248,D008099,D017093,D006498,D008115,D000860,D002331,D008055",5,15,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

We administered third monovalent mRNA vaccines to n = 81 KTRs with negative or low-titer anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody (n = 39 anti-RBD<sup>NEG</sup>; n = 42 anti-RBD<sup>LO</sup>), compared with healthy controls (HCs, n = 19), measuring anti-RBD, Omicron neutralization, spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup>%, and SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. By day 30, 44% anti-RBD<sup>NEG</sup> remained seronegative; 5% KTRs developed BA.5 neutralization (vs 68% HCs, P < .001). Day 30 spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup>% was negative in 91% KTRs (vs 20% HCs; P = .07), without correlation to anti-RBD (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.17). Day 30 SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR repertoires were detected in 52% KTRs vs 74% HCs (P = .11). Spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> TCR expansion was similar between KTRs and HCs, yet KTR CD8<sup>+</sup> TCR depth was 7.6-fold lower (P = .001). Global negative response was seen in 7% KTRs, associated with high-dose MMF (P = .037); 44% showed global positive response. Of the KTRs, 16% experienced breakthrough infections, with 2 hospitalizations; prebreakthrough variant neutralization was poor. Absent neutralizing and CD8<sup>+</sup> responses in KTRs indicate vulnerability to COVID-19 despite 3-dose mRNA vaccination. Lack of neutralization despite CD4<sup>+</sup> expansion suggests B cell dysfunction and/or ineffective T cell help. Development of more effective KTR vaccine strategies is critical.

Among the known base transporters, those within the SLC4 and SLC26 gene families are involved in cell, transepithelial, and whole organ function. Whether the functional properties of these transporters involve HCO3-, CO32-, or HCO3-/CO32- stimulated H+ (or OH-) transport has not received widespread attention in the literature. Accordingly, ""bicarbonate"" is the term typically used in most textbooks without greater specificity. Moreover, clinicians and physiologists have historically focused on the blood HCO3- concentration as the base term in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in the analysis of clinical acid-base abnormalities, thus, bicarbonate has been assumed to be the species reabsorbed along the nephron as required to maintain the blood [HCO3-] at approximately 25 mM. However, accumulating data in the literature suggest that carbonate, rather than bicarbonate, is the species absorbed across the proximal tubule basolateral membrane, whereas in the collecting duct, bicarbonate is indeed transported.

Intermittent hemodialysis (HD) and continuous KRT (CKRT) are the main modalities in critically ill patients with AKI. CKRT is the preferred modality in many countries because of its alleged superiority on both hemodynamic tolerance and on kidney function recovery. In fact, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the two modalities have not shown any actual benefit of one technique over the other on mortality, hemodynamics, or kidney function recovery. Those RCTs were conducted more than 15 years ago. Major progress was eventually made leading to much lower mortality rates in recent studies than in previous studies. In addition, those RCTs included a noticeable proportion of patients who could have recovered without ever receiving KRT, as demonstrated by several recent studies. In the absence of evidence of clinical superiority of one KRT modality, the choice must be addressed not only regarding clinical outcome but also resources and logistics. Conclusions of health technology assessments and study reports were heterogeneous and conflicting concerning cost-effectiveness of intermittent HD versus CKRT. All these considerations justify a reevaluation of the issue in new RCTs that take into account recent knowledge on KRT initiation and management. Pending results of such study, the choice should be guided mainly by organizational considerations in each unit and without condemning any modality in the absence of proof.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,,9.8,,,2,3,Journal Article

The donor's cause of death was freshwater drowning in a river, raising suspicion of potential donor-derived transmission, because Legionella bacteria naturally live in fresh water. Further investigation of patients receiving other organs from the same donor did not identify additional legionellosis cases. Health care-associated infection caused by water exposure at the hospital was also evaluated as a potential source of infection and was found to be unlikely. Hospital water quality parameter measurements collected during May-June 2022 were within expected ranges and no water disruptions were noted, although no testing for Legionella was performed during this period.

We describe successful lung transplantation for a COVID-19-related lung injury using lungs from a COVID-19-recovered donor who was retrospectively found to have detectable genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lung tissue by multiple highly sensitive assays. However, SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), a marker of viral replication, was not detectable in the donor respiratory tissues. One year after lung transplantation, the recipient has a good functional status, walking 1 mile several times per week without the need for supplemental oxygen and without any evidence of donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our findings highlight the limitations of current clinical laboratory diagnostic assays in detecting the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lung tissue. The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the donor tissue did not appear to represent active viral replication via sgRNA testing and, most importantly, did not negatively impact the allograft outcome in the first year after lung transplantation. sgRNA is easily performed and may be a useful assay for assessing viral infectivity in organs from donors with a recent infection.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Humans,COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2,Subgenomic RNA,RNA, Viral,Retrospective Studies,Lung Transplantation,Allografts","D006801,D000086382,D000086402,D000094762,D012367,D012189,D016040,D064591",12,20,"Journal Article,Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural"

The use of donors after cardiac death, especially after the outbreak of normothermic regional perfusion, has increased in recent years for all solid organs except the intestine, mainly because of its higher susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury. We present the first literature case of multivisceral donors after cardiac death transplantation in a 13-month-old recipient from a 2.5-month-old donor. Once exitus was certified, an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit was established, cannulating the aorta and infrarenal vena cava, while the supra-aortic branches were clamped. The abdominal organs completely recovered from ischemia through normothermic regional perfusion (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initially and beating heart later). After perfusion with the preservation solution, the multivisceral graft was uneventfully implanted. Two months later, the patient was discharged without any complications. This case demonstrates the possibility of reducing the time spent on the waiting list for these patients.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Humans,Child,Infant,Organ Preservation,Tissue Donors,Death,Tissue and Organ Harvesting,Perfusion,Tissue and Organ Procurement","D006801,D002648,D007223,D009926,D014019,D003643,D020858,D010477,D009927",13,21,"Case Reports,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

We identified ACLF patients who underwent LT in the University of California Health Data Warehouse. We applied the RuleFit machine learning (ML) algorithm to extract rules from decision trees and create intermediate models. We asked human experts to rate the rules generated by RuleFit and incorporated these ratings to generate final EAML models. We identified 1384 ACLF patients. For death at 1 year, areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were 0.707 (confidence interval [CI] 0.625-0.793) for EAML and 0.719 (CI 0.640-0.800) for RuleFit.

The interplay of various modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors confers this risk. Traditional models of cardiometabolic disease progression and CKD evaluation may not be applicable in this population with a unique genetic predisposition and phenotype. A wider understanding of dietary and lifestyle influences, genetic and metabolic risk factors, and the pitfalls of conventional equations estimating kidney function in this population are required in providing care for kidney diseases. Targeted screening of this population for metabolic and vascular risk factors and individualized management plan for disease management may be necessary. Addressing unhealthy dietary patterns, promoting physical activity, and medication management that adheres to cultural factors are crucial steps to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular disease and CKD in this population.

Recently, it has been found that variants in the TBC1D8B gene on the X chromosome can lead to early-onset focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome by affecting endocytosis and recycling of nephrin. Here, we report a 19-year-old Chinese patient with nephrotic syndrome and normal kidney function. He had a complete remission of nephrotic syndrome after full-dose prednisone and cyclosporine treatment. Unfortunately, a relapse of nephrotic syndrome occurred during prednisone tapering. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was proven by a kidney biopsy, and a hemizygous pathogenic variant located in the TBC (Tre-2-Bub2-Cdc16) domain of TBC1D8B was detected by whole-exome sequencing. By comparing our case with reports of other patients with TBC1D8B variants, we suggest possible genotype-phenotype correlations. To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying a pathogenetic variant in the TBC domain of TBC1D8B in an adult-onset focal segmental glomerulosclerosis patient with steroid-dependent NS.

Herein, we describe our 7-year experience applying NMP to extend preservation time in liver transplantation using a ""back-to-base"" approach. From 2015 to 2021, 79 livers were transplanted following NMP, compared with 386 after SCS only. NMP livers were preserved for a median time of minutes compared with minutes in the SCS cohort (P < .0001). Despite this, we observed significantly improved 30-day graft survival (P = .030), although there were no differences in long-term patient survival, major complications, or biliary or vascular complications. We also found that although SCS time was strongly associated with increased graft failure at 1 year in the SCS cohort (P = .006), there was no such association among NMP livers (P = .171).

The liver was additionally placed on an ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion, and the kidney was maintained on hypothermic machine perfusion while awaiting implantation. The heart transplant was completed first (cold ischemic time [CIT]: 131 minutes), followed by the liver transplant (CIT: 87 minutes, normothermic machine perfusion: 301 minutes). Kidney transplantation was performed the following day (CIT: 1833 minutes). He is 8 months posttransplant without evidence of heart, liver, or kidney graft dysfunction or rejection. This case highlights the feasibility of normothermic recovery and storage modalities for DCD donors, which can expand transplant opportunities for allografts previously not considered for multiorgan transplantations.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Male,Humans,Adult,Tissue and Organ Procurement,Kidney Transplantation,Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis,Organ Preservation,Tissue Donors,Perfusion,Liver,Death","D008297,D006801,D000328,D009927,D016030,D000075363,D009926,D014019,D010477,D008099,D003643",9,20,Case Reports

Managing policies to thoughtfully allocate this scarce resource is a complex process. Although human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching has been shown to prolong graft survival, its relative contribution to allocation schemes is empirically compromised owing to competing priorities. We explored using a new metric, Matched Donor Potential (MDP), to facilitate improved HLA matching while promoting equity. We interrogated all active kidney waitlist patients (N = 164 427), their corresponding unacceptable antigen files, and all effective donors in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (January 1, 2016-December 31, 2017). Cause-specific hazard functions were evaluated to assess the potential impact of the MDP metric on deceased donor transplant access rates for all candidates. Access was affected by ethnicity, blood group type, and calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA). Importantly, we show that access to transplantation is influenced by the patient's own HLA makeup regardless of their ethnicity and by the HLA makeup of effective donors. The MDP metric demonstrates a high association with access to transplantation. Adjusting Cox models to include this new metric resulted in improved access to kidney transplantation for waitlist candidates of minority heritage while significantly promoting HLA matching. Thus, the MDP metric accounts for balanced, equitable organ allocation algorithms.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Humans,Kidney Transplantation,Tissue and Organ Procurement,Tissue Donors,Kidney,HLA Antigens,Graft Survival,Histocompatibility Testing","D006801,D016030,D009927,D014019,D007668,D006680,D006085,D006650",3,4,Journal Article

SA-TM protein expressed in insect cells showed the expected structural and functional features. SA-TM converted protein C into activated protein C, blocked phagocytosis of xenogeneic cells by mouse macrophages and inhibited neutrophil activation. SA-TM was effectively displayed on the surface of biotinylated islets without a negative effect on their viability or function.

The participant's histopathology was consistent with mild acute tubular injury, without significant interstitial fibrosis or tubular atrophy. This diagnosis was supported by analysis of the glomerular and tubulointerstitial proteomes.

Identifying individuals at an increased risk of EBV-positive PTLD could influence clinical management of immunosuppression and other therapies, improving posttransplant outcomes. A 7-center prospective, observational clinical trial of 872 pediatric transplant recipients evaluated the presence of mutations at positions 212 and 366 of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) as an indicator of risk of EBV-positive PTLD (clinical trials: NCT02182986). DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of EBV-positive PTLD case patients and matched controls (1:2 nested case:control), and the cytoplasmic tail of LMP1 was sequenced. Thirty-four participants reached the primary endpoint of biopsy-proven EBV-positive PTLD. DNA was sequenced from 32 PTLD case patients and 62 matched controls. Both LMP1 mutations were present in 31 of 32 PTLD cases (96.9%) and in 45 of 62 matched controls (72.6%) (P = .005; OR = 11.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5, 92.6). The presence of both G212S and S366T carries a nearly 12-fold increased risk of development of EBV-positive PTLD. Conversely, transplant recipients without both LMP1 mutations carry a very low risk of PTLD. Analysis of mutations at positions 212 and 366 of LMP1 can be informative in stratifying patients for risk of EBV-positive PTLD.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,U01 AI104342/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States UM2 AI117870/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States ,DISCLOSURES.

Generated in the periphery, iT<sub>reg</sub> cells are suitable for responding to alloantigens and preventing transplant rejection. Nevertheless, their clinical application has been impeded by the plasticity and instability attributed to the loss of forkhead box protein 3 expression, raising concerns that iT<sub>reg</sub> may be converted to effector T cells and even exert a pathogenic effect. Herein, second-generation short hairpin RNAs loaded with 3 pairs of small interfering RNAs were utilized to target the T-box transcription factor TBX21. In addition, 2 immunosuppressive cytokines, namely, transforming growth factor beta and interleukin 10, were constitutively expressed. This novel engineering strategy allowed the generation of stably induced regulatory T (SI T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which maintained the expression of forkhead box protein 3 even in an unfavorable environment and exerted potent immunosuppressive functions in vitro. Furthermore, SI T<sub>reg</sub> cells demonstrated an effector transcriptional profile. Finally, SI T<sub>reg</sub> cells showed a significant protective effect against graft-versus-host disease-related deaths in a xenotransplantation model. Collectively, these results signify that SI T<sub>reg</sub> cells hold great promise for future clinical application and offer a rational therapeutic approach for transplant rejection.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,8.8,"Humans,T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory,Cytokines,Ectopic Gene Expression,Graft vs Host Disease,Forkhead Transcription Factors","D006801,D050378,D016207,D000066630,D006086,D051858",4,7,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Although GRK4 variants with elevated kinase activity have been associated with salt-sensitive or essential hypertension, this association has been inconsistent among different study populations. In addition, studies elucidating how GRK4 may modulate cellular signaling are sparse. In an analysis of how GRK4 affects the developing kidney, the authors found that GRK4 modulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Loss of GRK4 in embryonic zebrafish causes kidney dysfunction and glomerular cysts. Moreover, GRK4 depletion in zebrafish and cellular mammalian models results in elongated cilia.

We assessed adherence practices, reactions to monitoring technologies, and opportunities for care integration. One-size-fits-all approaches were deemed infeasible. Interviewees considered text messages the most acceptable approach; live video checks were the least acceptable and raised the most concerns for inconvenience and invasiveness. Digestion-activated signaling technology produced both excitement and apprehension. Patients and care partners generally aligned in perceptions of adherence monitoring integration into clinical care. Key themes were importance of routine, ease of use, leveraging technology for actionable medication changes, and aversion to surveillance. Transplant clinicians similarly considered text messages most acceptable and video checks least acceptable.

The analysis was repeated in 300 patients from an independent comparison cohort. Time-dependent multivariable Cox models were constructed to evaluate the association between A-score and chronic lung allograft dysfunction or graft failure. Landmark analyses were performed with A-score calculated at 6 and 12 months posttransplant. In the primary cohort, no association was found between A-score and graft outcome. However, in the comparison cohort, time-dependent A-score was associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction both as a time-dependent variable (hazard ratio, 1.51; P < .01) and when calculated at 6 months posttransplant (hazard ratio, 1.355; P = .031).

Several previous early therapies are no longer effective against new circulating variants. We performed a prospective cohort study in outpatient adult SOTr during the omicron BA.2 wave (April-May 2022), to determine the effectiveness of 3 doses of remdesivir given within 7 days of symptoms onset. Patients were followed for at least 30 days. The primary outcome was hospitalization. Of 210 SOTr that had COVID-19, we included 192. The median age was 54.5 years and 61.5% were men. The most common transplants were kidney (41.7%), lung (19.3%), liver (18.8%), and heart (6.3%). Most patients (90.1%) had previously received ≥3 COVID-19 vaccine doses. Fifteen (7.8%) were hospitalized, 5(2.6%) required supplemental oxygen, 3(1.6%) ICU admission, and 2(1%) mechanical ventilation with 2(1%) deaths. Age, the number of comorbidities, prednisone chronic treatment, and lung transplant were risk factors for hospitalization. Early remdesivir significantly decreased the hospitalization rate: adjusted hazard ratio 0.12 (95% CI: 0.03-0.57). The adjusted number needed to treat to prevent one hospitalization was 15.2 (95% CI: 13.6-31.4). No patient that received early remdesivir needed ICU admission or died.

The most cost-effective way to prevent infectious complications is through vaccination, which can potentially prevent infections due to hepatitis B (HBV) virus, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and invasive pneumococcal diseases. Here, we performed a retrospective analysis of HBV, HAV, and pneumococcal immunity in pediatric liver transplant recipients between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2020, to collect data on immunization and vaccine serology. A total of 94% (58/62) patients had available vaccination records. At transplant, 90% (45/50) were seroprotected against HBV, 63% (19/30) against HAV, and 78% (18/23) had pneumococcal immunity, but immunity against these 3 pathogens remained suboptimal during the 9-year follow-up. A booster vaccine was administered to only 20% to 40% of patients. Children who had received >4 doses of HBV vaccine and > 2 doses of HAV vaccine pretransplant displayed a higher overall seroprotection over time post-solid organ transplant.

Electronic address: istvan.mucsi@utoronto.ca.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney failure, and kidney replacement therapies are associated with high symptom burden and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Symptoms change with disease progression or transition between treatment modalities and frequently go unreported and unmanaged. Tools that reliably monitor symptoms may improve the management of patients with CKD. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess symptom severity; physical, psychological, social, and cognitive functioning; treatment-related side effects; and HRQOL. Systematic use of PROMs can improve patient-provider communication, patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and HRQOL. Potential barriers to their use include a lack of engagement, response burden, and limited guidance about PROM collection, score interpretation, and workflow integration. Well-defined, acceptable, and effective clinical response pathways are essential for implementing PROMs. PROMs developed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) address some challenges and may be suitable for clinical use among patients with CKD. PROMIS tools assess multiple patient-valued, clinically actionable symptoms and functions. They can be administered as fixed-length, customized short forms or computer adaptive tests, offering precise measurement across a range of symptom severities or function levels, tailored questions to individuals, and reduced question burden. Here we provide an overview of the potential use of PROMs in CKD care, with a focus on PROMIS.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Quality of Life,Patient Reported Outcome Measures,Patient Satisfaction,Renal Insufficiency, Chronic,Information Systems","D006801,D011788,D000071066,D017060,D051436,D007256",5,8,Journal Article

Electronic address: Andrew.House@lhsc.on.ca.","Declining kidney function in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is often attributed to large lesions, including angiomyolipomas (AMLs) and cysts, that encroach on the normal parenchyma or that require intervention and loss of parenchyma from surgical debulking or embolization. Consequently, research on inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein complex implicated in TSC pathophysiology for its role in promoting cell growth and proliferation, has largely focused on their ability to reduce AML size. Clinical guidelines distilled from this research limit mTOR inhibition as a first-line treatment to patients with large AMLs. However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in patients without large AMLs or a history of renal intervention. Alternate mechanisms postulated for CKD in TSC may suggest a role for mTOR inhibition in this population. In this report, we present 2 cases of a microscopic variant of TSC kidney disease causing declining kidney function, as well as anecdotal evidence for the use of mTOR inhibition to improve kidney function in the absence of large AMLs. We highlight the importance of annual kidney function assessment in patients with TSC and suggest a low threshold for kidney biopsy in patients with declining glomerular filtration rate without a clear etiology clinically or radiographically.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Tuberous Sclerosis,Kidney Neoplasms,Sirolimus,Kidney,Angiomyolipoma,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,Renal Insufficiency, Chronic","D006801,D014402,D007680,D020123,D007668,D018207,D058570,D051436",3,3,Case Reports

However, spurious electrolyte disorders can complicate the interpretation and management of these patients. Several electrolytes can be artifactually increased or decreased such that the serum electrolyte values do not correspond to their actual systemic levels, potentially resulting in extensive diagnostic investigations and therapeutic interventions. Examples of spurious derangements include pseudohyponatremia, pseudohypokalemia, pseudohyperkalemia, pseudohypophosphatemia, pseudohyperphosphatemia, and artifactual acid-base abnormalities. Correctly interpreting these artifactual laboratory abnormalities is imperative for avoiding unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in cancer patients. The factors influencing these spurious results also must be recognized, along with the steps to minimize them. We present a narrative review of commonly reported pseudo electrolyte disorders and describe strategies to exclude erroneous interpretations of these laboratory values and avoid pitfalls.

The current monitoring paradigm utilizes blood, urine, and tissue markers that are insensitive, nonspecific, or invasive to obtain. As a result, problems are detected late, after significant damage has accrued, and often beyond the time at which complete resolution is possible. Indeed, most kidney transplants eventually fail, usually because of chronic rejection and other undetected injury. There is a clear need for a transplant-specific biomarker that enables a proactive approach to monitoring via early detection of reversible pathology. A biomarker that supports timely and personalized treatment would assist in achieving the ultimate goal of improving allograft survival and limiting therapeutic toxicity to the recipient. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) has been proposed as one such transplant biomarker. Although the test is presently utilized most in the United States, it is conceivable that its use will become more widespread. This review covers aspects of ddcfDNA that support informed use of the test by general nephrologists, including the basic biology of ddcfDNA, methodological nuances of testing, and general recommendations for use in the kidney transplant population. Clinical contexts are used to illustrate evidence-supported interpretation of ddcfDNA results and subsequent management.

Modern sequencing platforms simultaneously sequence millions of RNA molecules. Advances in bioinformatics have allowed us to collect, store, analyze, and disseminate data from RNA-seq experiments and decipher biological insights from large sequencing datasets. Although bulk RNA-seq has significantly advanced our understanding of tissue-specific gene expression and regulation, recent advances in single-cell RNA-seq have allowed such information to be mapped to individual cells, thus remarkably enhancing our insight into discrete cellular functions within a biospecimen. These different RNA-seq experimental approaches require specialized computational tools.

Because of the concern about the syndrome, some transplants of mismatched grafts may not be performed. Portal hyperperfusion of a small graft and hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation are recognized as main pathogenic factors for the syndrome. Management of established SFSS is guided by the severity of the presentation with the initial focus on pharmacological therapy to modulate portal flow and provide supportive care to the patient with the goal of facilitating graft regeneration and recovery. When medical management fails or condition progresses with impending dysfunction or even liver failure, interventional radiology (IR) and/or surgical interventions to reduce portal overperfusion should be considered. Although most patients have good outcomes with medical, IR, and/or surgical management that allow graft regeneration, the risk of graft loss increases dramatically in the setting of bilirubin >10 mg/dL and INR>1.6 on postoperative day 7 or isolated bilirubin >20 mg/dL on postoperative day 14.

Posttransplant TMA (PT-TMA) may occur either de novo or as a recurrence of the disease. De novo TMA can be triggered by immunosuppressant drugs, antibody-mediated rejection, viral infections, and ischemia/reperfusion injury in patients with no evidence of the disease before transplantation. Recurrent TMA may occur in the kidney grafts of patients with a history of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in the native kidneys. Studies have shown that some patients with aHUS carry genetic abnormalities that affect genes that code for complement regulators (CFH, MCP, CFI) and components (C3 and CFB), whereas in 10% of patients (mostly children), anti-FH autoantibodies have been reported. The incidence of aHUS recurrence is determined by the underlying genetic or acquired complement abnormality. Although treatment of the causative agents is usually the first line of treatment for de novo PT-TMA, this approach might be insufficient. Plasma exchange typically resolves hematologic abnormalities but does not improve kidney function.

These devices have undergone significant technological advancements over the years, and contemporary LVADs prolong life substantially in patients dependent on inotropic therapy or in those with severe ambulatory advanced heart failure with a median survival that exceeds 5 y, and most patients benefit from a doubling in functional capacity, even among those intended as destination therapy because of ineligibility for transplantation. Other intended goals for LVAD implantation consist of (1) bridge to remission or recovery and (2) bridge to transplant or candidacy for transplant. In the former situation, few selected patients underwent LVAD implantation, facilitating myocardial remission to recovery that allowed explantation. Among those bridged to transplantation, survival in the intended goal was excellent, with 80% success at 5 y (with a 50% rate of transplantation). In this review, we provide a brief historical background on the evolution of LVADs and discuss outcomes with contemporary pumps, immunological and infection-related impact of such devices, impact of bridging in HT, and use of devices for facilitating myocardial recovery and remission. Furthermore, we discuss implications of HT allocation policies, with a specific focus within the United States, and outline future perspectives and novel device in development.",Transplantation,,"M.R.M. reports payment made to institution from Abbott for consulting, consulting fees from Mesoblast, Janssen, Moderna, Paragonix, and Baim Institute for Clinical Research, and advisory board member for Transmedics, NuPulseCV, Leviticus, and FineHeart.

Innate B-1 cells and marginal zone B cells may relocate to lymphoid follicles and differentiate into cytokine and antibody-secreting cells in T-independent and T-dependent manners. Although marginal zone B cells are widely described in humans, the presence of B-1 cells is more controversial. Here, we review the basic features of the innate B-cell subsets identified in mice and their equivalent in humans, as well as their potential roles in transplantation. We summarize the findings of Cascalho and colleagues on the unexpected protective role of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B in regulating circulating levels of protective natural immunoglobulin M, and the studies by Zorn and colleagues on the potential pathogenic role for polyreactive innate B cells infiltrating allograft explants. Finally, we discuss our studies that took a transcriptomic approach to identify innate B cells infiltrating kidney allografts with antibody-mediated rejection and to demonstrate that local antigens within the allograft together with inflammation may induce a loss of B-cell tolerance.",Transplantation,P01 AI097113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States R01 AI142747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States R01 AI148705/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States ,This work was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (AI142747 and AI148705) to A.S.C.

Perfusion has increasingly replaced static cold storage as the preferred and even gold standard preservation method for marginal-quality organs. Perfusion is dynamic and offers several advantages in comparison with static cold storage. These include the ability to provide a continuous supply of new metabolic substrates, clear metabolic waste products, and perform some degree of organ viability assessment before actual transplantation in the recipient. At the same time, the ongoing importance of static cold storage cannot be overlooked, in particular when it comes to logistical and technical convenience and cost, not to mention the fact that it continues to work well for the majority of transplant allografts. The present review article provides an overview of the fundamental concepts of organ preservation, providing a brief history of static cold preservation and description of the principles behind and basic components of cold preservation solutions. An evaluation of current evidence supporting the use of different preservation solutions in abdominal organ transplantation is provided. As well, the range of solutions used for machine perfusion of abdominal organs is described, as are variations in their compositions related to changing metabolic needs paralleling the raising of the temperature of the perfusate from hypothermic to normothermic range.

Machine perfusion (MP) techniques are applied in various fields of solid organ transplantation today. The first clinical series of ex situ MP in liver transplantation was presented in 2010. Since then, the number of research and clinical applications has substantially increased. Despite the notable beneficial effect on organ quality and recipient outcome, MP is still not routinely used in liver transplantation. Based on the enormous need to better preserve organs and the subsequent demand to continuously innovate and develop perfusion equipment further, this technology is also beneficial to test and deliver future therapeutic strategies to livers before implantation. This article summarizes the various challenges observed during the current shift from static to dynamic liver preservation in the clinical setting. The different organ perfusion strategies are discussed first, together with ongoing clinical trials and future study design. The current status of research and the impact of costs and regulations is highlighted next. Factors contributing to costs and other required resources for a worldwide successful implementation and reimbursement are presented third. The impact of research on cost-utility and effectivity to guide the tailored decision-making regarding the optimal perfusion strategy is discussed next.

The current status and state-of-the-art of biomarker research in CLAD will be discussed with a particular focus on radiological biomarkers or biomarkers found in peripheral tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage' and circulating blood' in which significant progress has been made over the last years. Ultimately, although a growing number of biomarkers are currently being embedded in the follow-up of lung transplant patients, it is clear that one size does not fit all. The future of biomarker research probably lies in the rigorous combination of clinical information with findings in tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage' or blood.

The aim of this study is to systematically review studies that utilized a CDSS and assess impact on patient outcomes. A total of 48 articles were identified as meeting the author-derived inclusion criteria, including tools for posttransplant monitoring, pretransplant risk assessment, waiting list management, immunosuppressant management, and interpretation of histopathology. Studies included 15 984 transplant recipients. Tools aimed at helping with transplant patient immunosuppressant management were the most common (19 studies). Thirty-four studies (85%) found an overall clinical benefit following the implementation of a CDSS in clinical practice. Although there are limitations to the existing literature, current evidence suggests that implementing CDSS in transplant clinical settings may improve outcomes for patients.

Over the past few decades, the EVLP technique has become recognized as a significant achievement and gained much attention in the field of lung transplantation. EVLP has been demonstrated to be an effective platform for various targeted therapies to optimize donor lung function before transplantation. Additionally, some physical parameters during EVLP and biological markers in the EVLP perfusate can be used to evaluate graft function before transplantation and predict posttransplant outcomes. However, despite its advantages, the clinical practice of EVLP continuously encounters multiple challenges associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic limitations. It is of utmost importance to address the advantages and disadvantages of EVLP for its broader clinical usage. Here, the pros and cons of EVLP are comprehensively discussed, with a focus on its benefits and potential approaches for overcoming the remaining limitations.

Regulatory B Cells in Solid Organ Transplantation: From Immune Monitoring to Immunotherapy.,37779239,"Charbel Elias,Chuxiao Chen,Aravind Cherukuri","Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.","Regulatory B cells (Breg) modulate the immune response in diverse disease settings including transplantation. Despite the lack of a specific phenotypic marker or transcription factor, their significance in transplantation is underscored by their ability to prolong experimental allograft survival, the possibility for their clinical use as immune monitoring tools, and the exciting prospect for them to form the basis for cell therapy. Interleukin (IL)-10 expression remains the most widely used marker for Breg. Several Breg subsets with distinct phenotypes that express this ""signature Breg cytokine"" have been described in mice and humans. Although T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin family-1 is the most inclusive and functional marker that accounts for murine Breg with disparate mechanisms of action, the significance of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin family-1 as a marker for Breg in humans still needs to be explored. Although the primary focus of this review is the role of Breg in clinical transplantation, the net modulatory effect of B cells on the immune response and clinical outcomes is the result of the balancing functions of both Breg and effector B cells. Supporting this notion, B-cell IL-10/tumor necrosis factor α ratio is shown to predict immunologic reactivity and clinical outcomes in kidney and liver transplantation. Assessment of Breg:B effector balance using their IL-10/tumor necrosis factor α ratio may identify patients that require more immunosuppression and provide mechanistic insights into potential therapies.

As a direct result of this expertise, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first in-human transplantation of a genetically engineered cardiac xenograft through an expanded access application for a single patient. This clinical case demonstrated the feasibility of xenotransplantation.

Cotransplantation of donor hematopoietic cells to achieve chimerism is a promising approach for tolerance induction, which was successfully tested in clinical trials. However, current protocols are associated with side effects related to the myelosuppressive recipient conditioning, which makes it difficult to introduce them as standard therapy. More recently, adoptive cell therapy with polyclonal or donor-specific regulatory T cells (Treg) proved safe and feasible in several transplant trials, but it is unclear whether it can induce tolerance on its own. The combination of both approaches-Treg therapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation-leads to chimerism and tolerance without myelosuppressive treatment in murine models. Treg therapy promotes engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic cells, reducing conditioning requirements and enhancing regulatory mechanisms maintaining tolerance.

Immune-mediated transplant rejection is a common complication that decreases allograft survival. Although immunosuppression is required to prevent rejection, it also increases the risk of infection. Some infections, such as cytomegalovirus and BK virus, can promote inflammatory gene expression that can further tip the balance toward rejection. BK virus and other infections can induce damage that resembles the clinical pathology of rejection, and this complicates accurate diagnosis. Moreover, T cells specific for viral infection can lead to rejection through heterologous immunity to donor antigen directly mediated by antiviral cells.

At the core of diverse and inclusive teams is a rich diversity of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds that invite new questions and broaden the scope of research. Diverse perspectives are especially relevant for biomedicine, which seeks to find solutions for challenging problems affecting the human condition. It is essential that diversity and inclusion in biomedicine is prioritized as a key driver of innovation, both through the people who conduct the research and the science itself. Key questions have been articulated as important drivers for funding research: (1) Who is doing the science and who is building the tools? (2) What science and technology is being done and how? and (3) Who has access to the knowledge and benefits of scientific innovation? I will briefly review the empirical evidence supporting diversity as a powerful enhancer of the quality and outputs of research and clinical care. I offer my own research as a case study of incorporating a framework of diversity, equity, and inclusion into research that uses new emerging genomic tools for earlier and more precise diagnosis of organ transplant rejection. I will demonstrate how these same tools hold great promise for accelerating the discovery of hitherto unexplored mechanisms that drive the poor outcomes for African ancestry organ transplant recipients, which in turn will identify new diagnostics and therapeutic targets that benefit transplant recipients across all ancestries.",Transplantation,,,6.2,"Humans,United States,Organ Transplantation,Genomics","D006801,D014481,D016377,D023281",1,1,Journal Article
Normothermic Machine Perfusion Systems: Where Do We Go From Here?,37026713,"Sara López-Martínez,Carlos Simón,Xavier Santamaria","Carlos Simon Foundation, Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe, Valencia, Spain.","Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) aims to preserve organs ex vivo by simulating physiological conditions such as body temperature. Recent advancements in NMP system design have prompted the development of clinically effective devices for liver, heart, lung, and kidney transplantation that preserve organs for several hours/up to 1 d. In preclinical studies, adjustments to circuit structure, perfusate composition, and automatic supervision have extended perfusion times up to 1 wk of preservation. Emerging NMP platforms for ex vivo preservation of the pancreas, intestine, uterus, ovary, and vascularized composite allografts represent exciting prospects. Thus, NMP may become a valuable tool in transplantation and provide significant advantages to biomedical research. This review recaps recent NMP research, including discussions of devices in clinical trials, innovative preclinical systems for extended preservation, and platforms developed for other organs.

The Molecular Phenotype of Kidney Transplants: Insights From the MMDx Project.,37310258,"Philip F Halloran,Katelynn S Madill-Thomsen,Jeff Reeve","University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.","This review outlines the molecular disease states in kidney transplant biopsies as documented in the development of the Molecular Microscope Diagnostic System (MMDx). These states include T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), recent parenchymal injury, and irreversible atrophy-fibrosis. The MMDx project, initiated through a Genome Canada grant, is a collaboration involving many centers. MMDx uses genome-wide microarrays to measure transcript expression, interprets the results using ensembles of machine learning algorithms, and generates a report. Experimental studies in mouse models and cell lines were extensively used to annotate molecular features and interpret the biopsy results. Over time, MMDx revealed unexpected aspects of the disease states: for example, AMR is usually C4d-negative and often DSA-negative, and subtle ""Minor"" AMR-like states are frequent. Parenchymal injury correlates with both reduced glomerular filtration rate and increased risk of graft loss. In kidneys with rejection, injury features, not rejection activity, are the strongest predictors of graft survival. Both TCMR and AMR produce injury, but TCMR induces immediate nephron injury and accelerates atrophy-fibrosis, whereas AMR induces microcirculation and glomerular damage that slowly leads to nephron failure and atrophy-fibrosis. Plasma donor-derived cell-free DNA levels correlate strongly with AMR activity, acute kidney injury, and in a complex way with TCMR activity. Thus, the MMDx project has documented the molecular processes that underlie the clinical and histologic states in kidney transplants, and provides a diagnostic tool that can be used to calibrate biomarkers, optimize histology interpretation, and guide clinical trials.",Transplantation,"//This research has been principally supported by grants from Genome Canada, Canada Foundation for Innovation, the University of Alberta Hospital Foundation, the Alberta Ministry of Advanced Education, the Mendez National Institute of Transplantation Foundation, and Industrial Research Assistance Program.

However, because of a shortage of suitable donor livers, even of those patients who are placed on the donor liver waiting list, many do not survive the waiting time for transplantation. Therefore, alternative treatments for end-stage liver disease need to be explored. Recent advances in organoid technology might serve as a solution to overcome the donor liver shortage in the future. In this overview, we highlight the potential of organoid technology for cell therapy and tissue engineering approaches. Both organoid-based approaches could be used as treatment for end-stage liver disease patients. Additionally, organoid-based cell therapy can also be used to repair liver grafts ex vivo to increase the supply of transplantable liver tissue. The potential of both approaches to become clinically available is carefully assessed, including their clinical, ethical, and economic implications.

Although early transplants experienced acute organ injury, medical breakthroughs, such as tissue typing, and use of immunosuppressive agents have considerably improved graft survival. However, the overall incidence of allograft injury and chronic rejection remains high. Often the clinical manifestations of organ injury or rejection are nonspecific and late. Current requirement for successful organ transplantation is the identification of reliable, accurate, disease-specific, noninvasive methods for the early diagnosis of graft injury or rejection. Development of noninvasive techniques is important to allow routine follow-ups without the discomfort and risks associated with a graft biopsy. Multiple biofluids have been successfully tested for the presence of potential proteomic biomarkers; these include serum, plasma, urine, and whole blood. Kidney transplant research has provided significant evidence to the potential of proteomics-based biomarkers for acute and chronic kidney rejection, delayed graft function, early detection of declining allograft health. Multiple proteins have been implicated as biomarkers; however, recent observations implicate the use of similar canonical pathways and biofunctions associated with graft injury/rejection with altered proteins as potential biomarkers. Unfortunately, the current biomarker studies lack high sensitivity and specificity, adding to the complexity of their utility in the clinical space. In this review, we first describe the high-throughput proteomics technologies and then discuss the outcomes of proteomics profiling studies in the transplantation of several organs.

This technique detects and quantifies mRNA transcripts in situ, meaning that transcriptomic signatures can be sampled from specific cells, structures, lesions, or anatomical regions while conserving the physical relationships that exist within complex tissues. These methods now frequently implement next-generation sequencing, enabling the simultaneous measurement of many targets, up to and including the whole mRNA transcriptome. To date, spatial transcriptomics has been foremost used in the fields of neuroscience and oncology, but there is potential for its use in transplantation sciences. Transplantation has a clear dependence on biopsies for diagnosis, monitoring, and research. Transplant patients represent a unique cohort with multiple organs of interest, clinical courses, demographics, and immunosuppressive regimens.

The most striking alterations associated with immunosenescence have been observed in the T-cell compartment with a significant shift toward a terminally differentiated memory phenotype taking on features of innate immune cells. At the same time, cellular senescence impairs T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions, compromising the effectiveness of immunity. In clinical transplantation, T-cell immunosenescence has been the main driver of less frequent acute rejections in older transplant recipients. This patient population, at the same time, suffers more frequently from the side effects of immunosuppressive therapy including higher rates of infections, malignancies, and chronic allograft failure. T-cell senescence has also been identified as an instigator of age-specific organ dysfunction through a process that has been coined ""inflammaging,"" accelerating organ injury and potentially contributing to the limited lifetime of organ transplants. Here, we provide a summary of the latest evidence on molecular characteristics of T-cell senescence affecting alloimmunity and organ quality while dissecting the consequences of unspecific organ injury and immunosuppression on T-cell senescence.

To date, these solutions have been principally cell-based treatments and at present, in Europe, these therapies are regulated under European Union regulations for advanced therapy medicinal products. But now, new emerging technology combining cellular therapy with medical devices is under development. The potential of this novel hybrid model to create a bioartificial pancreas to treat type 1 diabetes is tantalizing. However, incorporating medical devices creates a further layer of regulatory complexity. This article seeks to expose the complexity of this legal and regulatory landscape and demonstrate how evolving technology could challenge the entire existing legal paradigm. We start by summarizing the status of the only established cell-based therapy-transplantation. We set out the regulation of cellular therapies, their classification, and the role of statutory bodies. We examine the bottleneck of therapies moving from bench to bedside, and we consider the additional challenges of products, which use a combination of cells and medical devices. Finally, we argue that for the potential of this rapidly growing area of technology to be realized a seismic shift in how we regulate frontier cellular therapies will be required.",Transplantation,,The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,6.2,"Humans,Regenerative Medicine,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1,Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy,European Union,Government Regulation","D006801,D044968,D003922,D064987,D005062,D033161",1,2,"Journal Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review"

The aim of this report is to review the first 8 y of our clinical heart transplant program at St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, to describe how our program has evolved and to report the impact that changes to our retrieval protocols have had on posttransplant outcomes. Since 2014, we have performed 74 DCD heart transplants from DCD donors utilizing a direct procurement protocol followed by normothermic machine perfusion. Changes to our retrieval protocol have resulted in a higher retrieval rate from DCD donors and fewer rejections of DCD hearts during normothermic machine perfusion. Compared with our previously reported early experience in the first 23 transplants, we have observed a significant reduction in the incidence of severe primary graft dysfunction from 35% (8/23) to 8% (4/51) in the subsequent 51 transplant recipients ( P < 0.01). The only withdrawal time interval significantly associated with severe primary graft dysfunction was the asystolic warm ischemic time: 15 (12-17) versus 13 (11-14) min ( P < 0.05). One- and 5-y survival of DCD heart transplant recipients was 94% and 88%, comparable to that of a contemporary cohort of donation after brain death recipients: 87 and 81% ( P -value was not significant).

One confounder that may underlie this discrepancy is the greater ischemic inflammation imposed on the transplants. In mice, cardiac allografts subjected to prolonged cold ischemic storage (CIS) before transplant have increased ischemia-reperfusion injury, which amplifies infiltrating endogenous memory CD8 T-cell activation within hours after transplantation to mediate acute graft inflammation and cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 immunoglobulin-resistant rejection.
