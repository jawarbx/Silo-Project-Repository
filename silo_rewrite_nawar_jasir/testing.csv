Although TMA lesions are often accompanied by clinical features of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ischemic end-organ injury, renal-limited forms of TMA are not infrequently encountered in clinical practice. The presence of renal-limited manifestations can be diagnostically challenging, often delaying the initiation of targeted therapy. Prompt investigation and empirical treatment of TMA is warranted to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Major advances have been made with respect to the pathophysiology of primary TMA entities, with the subsequent development of novel diagnostic tools and lifesaving therapies for diseases like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and complement-mediated TMA. This article will review the clinical presentation and pathologic hallmarks of TMA involving the kidney, and the disease-specific mechanisms that contribute to the endothelial injury that characterizes TMA lesions. Diagnostic approach and both empirical and disease-specific treatment strategies will be discussed, along with the potential role for emerging targeted disease-specific therapies.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Thrombotic Microangiopathies,Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic,Anemia, Hemolytic,Kidney,Plasma Exchange","D006801,D057049,D011697,D000743,D007668,D010951",5,5,"Journal Article,Review,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Continuous KRT comprises a spectrum of dialysis modalities preferably used to provide kidney support to patients with AKI who are hemodynamically unstable and critically ill. The various continuous KRT modalities are distinguished by different mechanisms of solute transport and use of dialysate and/or replacement solutions. Considerable variation exists in the application of continuous KRT due to a lack of standardization in how the treatments are prescribed, delivered, and optimized to improve patient outcomes. In this manuscript, we present an overview of the therapy, recent clinical trials, and outcome studies. We review the indications for continuous KRT and the technical aspects of the treatment, including continuous KRT modality, vascular access, dosing of continuous KRT, anticoagulation, volume management, nutrition, and continuous KRT complications.

Electronic address: joanne.bargman@uhn.ca.","As the global prevalence of peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to grow, practitioners must be equipped with prescribing strategies that focus on the needs and preferences of patients. PD is an effective form of kidney replacement therapy that offers numerous benefits to patients, including more flexibility in schedules compared with in-center hemodialysis (HD). Additional benefits of PD include salt and water removal without significant changes in patient hemodynamics. This continuous yet gentle removal of solutes and fluid is associated with better-preserved residual kidney function. Unfortunately, sometimes these advantages are overlooked at the expense of an emphasis on achieving small solute clearance targets. A more patient-centered approach emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment, particularly when considering incremental PD and other prescriptions that align with lifestyle preferences. In shifting the focus from small solute clearance targets to patient needs and clinical goals, PD remains an attractive, patient-centered form of kidney replacement therapy.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Renal Dialysis,Peritoneal Dialysis,Renal Replacement Therapy,Prescriptions,Water,Kidney Failure, Chronic","D006801,D006435,D010530,D017582,D055656,D014867,D007676",2,2,"Journal Article,Review,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The exact indications for initiating KRT have been debated for decades. There is a general consensus that KRT should be considered in patients with AKI and medically refractory complications (""urgent indications""). ""Relative indications"" are more common but defined with less precision. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence from recent landmark clinical trials, discuss strategies to anticipate the need for KRT in individual patients, and propose an algorithm for decision making. We emphasize that the decision to consider KRT should be made in conjunction with other forms of organ support therapies and important nonkidney factors, including the patient's preferences and overall goals of care. We also suggest future research to differentiate patients who benefit from timely initiation of KRT from those with imminent recovery of kidney function. Until then, efforts are needed to optimize the initiation and delivery of KRT in routine clinical practice, to minimize nonessential variation, and to ensure that patients with persistent AKI or progressive organ failure affected by AKI receive KRT in a timely manner.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,"S.M.

The paramount difficulty in the management of IgA nephropathy is the heterogeneity in its clinical presentation and prognosis, requiring an individualized treatment approach. Goal-directed supportive care remains the bedrock of therapy for all patients, regardless of risk of progression. Sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors and sparsentan should be integral to contemporary supportive care, particularly in patients with chronic kidney damage. Pending the development of reliable biomarkers, it remains a challenge to identify patients prone to progression due to active disease and most likely to derive a net benefit from immunosuppression. The use of clinical parameters, including the degree of proteinuria, the presence of persistent microscopic hematuria, and the rate of eGFR loss, combined with the mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, crescents score, is currently the best approach. Systemic glucocorticoids are indicated in high-risk patients, but the beneficial effects wane after withdrawal and come at the price of substantial treatment-associated toxicity. Therapies with direct effect on disease pathogenesis are increasingly becoming available. While targeted-release budesonide has garnered the most attention, anti-B-cell strategies and selective complement inhibition will most likely prove their added value.

The nephrologist may be involved in poisonings that cause kidney disease and for targeted treatments. The overall approach to the poisoned patient involves the initial acute resuscitation and performing a risk assessment, whereby the exposure is considered in terms of the anticipated severity and in the context of the patient's status and treatments that may be required. Time-critical interventions such as gastrointestinal decontamination ( e.g. , activated charcoal) and antidotes are administered when indicated. The nephrologist is usually involved when elimination enhancement techniques are required, such as urine alkalinization or extracorporeal treatments. There is increasing data to guide decision making for the use of extracorporeal treatments in the poisoned patient. Principles to consider are clinical indications such as whether severe toxicity is present, anticipated, and/or will persist and whether the poison will be significantly removed by the extracorporeal treatment. Extracorporeal clearance is maximized for low-molecular weight drugs that are water soluble with minimal protein binding (<80%) and low endogenous clearance and volume of distribution. The dosage of some antidotes ( e.g. , N-acetylcysteine, ethanol, fomepizole) should be increased to maintain therapeutic concentrations once the extracorporeal treatment is initiated. To maximize the effect of an extracorporeal treatment, blood and effluent flows should be optimized, the filter with the largest surface area selected, and duration tailored to remove enough poison to reduce toxicity. Intermittent hemodialysis is recommended in most cases when an extracorporeal treatment is required because it is the most efficient, and continuous kidney replacement therapy is prescribed in some circumstances, particularly if intermittent hemodialysis is not readily available.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,,,9.8,"Humans,Antidotes,Charcoal,Acetylcysteine,Ethanol,Poisons,Poisoning","D006801,D000931,D002606,D000111,D000431,D011042,D011041",2,2,Journal Article

Intradialytic fatigue develops or worsens immediately before hemodialysis and persists through the dialysis treatment. Little is known about associated risk factors or pathophysiology, although it may relate to a classic conditioning response. Postdialysis fatigue (PDF) develops or worsens after hemodialysis and may persist for hours. There is no consensus on how to measure PDF. Estimates for the prevalence of PDF range from 20%-86%, likely due to variation in methods of ascertainment and participant characteristics. Several hypotheses seek to explain the pathophysiology of PDF, including inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and osmotic and fluid shifts, but none is currently supported by compelling or consistent data. PDF is associated with several clinical factors, including cardiovascular and hemodynamic effects of the dialysis procedure, laboratory abnormalities, depression, and physical inactivity. Clinical trials have reported hypothesis-generating data about the utility of cold dialysate, frequent dialysis, clearance of large middle molecules, treatment of depression, and exercise as potential treatments.

This installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology emphasizes the latest data available for prevention and management of infectious and noninfectious complications of PD. Through case vignettes, appropriate strategies for diagnosis and care of patients with PD peritonitis are reviewed as well as noninfectious complications evident in clinical practice including complications from increased intra-abdominal pressure, namely pericatheter and abdominal leaks, hernia formation, and complications from pleuroperitoneal communication (hydrothorax). Although rates of incisional hernias and pericatheter leaks have decreased with improved peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion techniques, these mechanical complications continue to be common occurrences and are reviewed via pertinent clinical vignettes which aim to address and discuss common implications of these scenarios. Finally, this Core Curriculum article covers a practical overview of peritoneal dialysis catheter dysfunction.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,,,13.2,"Humans,Peritoneal Dialysis,Peritonitis,Catheterization,Kidney Failure, Chronic","D006801,D010530,D010538,D002404,D007676",1,1,"Journal Article,Review"

Electronic address: juancarlos.velez@ochsner.org.","Individuals with liver disease are susceptible to pathophysiological derangements that lead to kidney dysfunction. Patients with advanced cirrhosis and acute liver failure (ALF) are at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1, also called HRS-AKI) constitutes a form of AKI unique to the state of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Although HRS-1 is a condition primarily characterized by marked renal vasoconstriction and kidney hypoperfusion, other pathogenic processes, such as acute tubular injury and renal vein congestion, can overlap and further complicate the course of HRS-1. ALF can lead to AKI through mechanisms that involve systemic inflammation, direct drug toxicity, or bile acid-induced tubulopathy. In addition, the growing prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is changing the spectrum of chronic kidney disease in cirrhosis. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we explore the underpinnings of how cirrhosis, ALF, acute cholestasis, and post-liver transplantation can be associated with various forms of acute, subacute, or chronic kidney diseases. We navigate through the recommended therapies for each condition, including supportive care, pharmacological interventions, kidney replacement therapy, and organ transplantation.

Decisions regarding fluid removal during critical illness are complex even for patients with preserved kidney function. This article seeks to apply general concepts of fluid management to the care of patients who also require KRT. Because optimal fluid management for any specific patient is likely to change over the course of critical illness, conceptual models using phases of care have been developed. In this review, we will examine the implications of one such model on the use of ultrafiltration during KRT for volume removal in distributive shock. This will also provide a useful lens to re-examine published data of KRT during critical illness. We will highlight recent prospective trials of KRT as well as recent retrospective studies examining ultrafiltration rate and mortality, review the results, and discuss applications and shortcomings of these studies. We also emphasize that current data and techniques suggest that optimal guidelines will not consist of recommendations for or against absolute fluid removal rates but will instead require the development of dynamic protocols involving frequent cycles of reassessment and adjustment of net fluid removal goals. If optimal fluid management is dynamic, then frequent assessment of fluid responsiveness, fluid toxicity, and tolerance of fluid removal will be needed. Innovations in our ability to assess these parameters may improve our management of ultrafiltration in the future.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,K23 DK129770/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States ,,9.8,"Humans,Critical Illness,Renal Replacement Therapy,Critical Care,Ultrafiltration,Fluid Therapy,Acute Kidney Injury","D006801,D016638,D017582,D003422,D014462,D005440,D058186",2,4,"Review,Journal Article"
