0,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), a pathological lesion observed in a wide spectrum of diseases, is triggered by endothelial injury and/or dysfunction. Although TMA lesions are often accompanied by clinical features of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ischemic end-organ injury, renal-limited forms of TMA are not infrequently encountered in clinical practice. The presence of renal-limited manifestations can be diagnostically challenging, often delaying the initiation of targeted therapy. Prompt investigation and empirical treatment of TMA is warranted to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Major advances have been made with respect to the pathophysiology of primary TMA entities, with the subsequent development of novel diagnostic tools and lifesaving therapies for diseases like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and complement-mediated TMA. This article will review the clinical presentation and pathologic hallmarks of TMA involving the kidney, and the disease-specific mechanisms that contribute to the endothelial injury that characterizes TMA lesions. Diagnostic approach and both empirical and disease-specific treatment strategies will be discussed, along with the potential role for emerging targeted disease-specific therapies.",Yes,,,"[{'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.29629915952682495, 'Cardionephrology': 0.21434110403060913, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.205282524228096, 'Onconephrology': 0.09424671530723572, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.0850345641374588, 'Blood Purification': 0.04345562681555748, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.03682110458612442, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.02451915107667446}]"

2,"AKI is a common complication of critical illness and is associated with substantial morbidity and risk of death. Continuous KRT comprises a spectrum of dialysis modalities preferably used to provide kidney support to patients with AKI who are hemodynamically unstable and critically ill. The various continuous KRT modalities are distinguished by different mechanisms of solute transport and use of dialysate and/or replacement solutions. Considerable variation exists in the application of continuous KRT due to a lack of standardization in how the treatments are prescribed, delivered, and optimized to improve patient outcomes. In this manuscript, we present an overview of the therapy, recent clinical trials, and outcome studies. We review the indications for continuous KRT and the technical aspects of the treatment, including continuous KRT modality, vascular access, dosing of continuous KRT, anticoagulation, volume management, nutrition, and continuous KRT complications.

3,"As the global prevalence of peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to grow, practitioners must be equipped with prescribing strategies that focus on the needs and preferences of patients. PD is an effective form of kidney replacement therapy that offers numerous benefits to patients, including more flexibility in schedules compared with in-center hemodialysis (HD). Additional benefits of PD include salt and water removal without significant changes in patient hemodynamics. This continuous yet gentle removal of solutes and fluid is associated with better-preserved residual kidney function. Unfortunately, sometimes these advantages are overlooked at the expense of an emphasis on achieving small solute clearance targets. A more patient-centered approach emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment, particularly when considering incremental PD and other prescriptions that align with lifestyle preferences. In shifting the focus from small solute clearance targets to patient needs and clinical goals, PD remains an attractive, patient-centered form of kidney replacement therapy.",Yes,,,"[{'Kidney Transplantation': 0.3455509543418884, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.17301258444786072, 'Cardionephrology': 0.16952168941497803, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.11171291768550873, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.0861261636018753, 'Blood Purification': 0.08203890919685364, 'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.019447794184088707, 'Onconephrology': 0.012588981539011002}]"
4,"KRT is considered for patients with severe AKI and associated complications. The exact indications for initiating KRT have been debated for decades. There is a general consensus that KRT should be considered in patients with AKI and medically refractory complications (""urgent indications""). ""Relative indications"" are more common but defined with less precision. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence from recent landmark clinical trials, discuss strategies to anticipate the need for KRT in individual patients, and propose an algorithm for decision making. We emphasize that the decision to consider KRT should be made in conjunction with other forms of organ support therapies and important nonkidney factors, including the patient's preferences and overall goals of care. We also suggest future research to differentiate patients who benefit from timely initiation of KRT from those with imminent recovery of kidney function. Until then, efforts are needed to optimize the initiation and delivery of KRT in routine clinical practice, to minimize nonessential variation, and to ensure that patients with persistent AKI or progressive organ failure affected by AKI receive KRT in a timely manner.",Yes,,,"[{'Kidney Transplantation': 0.6280585527420044, 'Cardionephrology': 0.14671999216079712, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.11846193671226501, 'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.05812062695622444, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.017691126093268394, 'Onconephrology': 0.01612143963575363, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.010097229853272438, 'Blood Purification': 0.004729155916720629}]"

6,"The pivotal event in the pathophysiology of IgA nephropathy is the binding of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes to mesangial cells, with secondary glomerular and tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. The paramount difficulty in the management of IgA nephropathy is the heterogeneity in its clinical presentation and prognosis, requiring an individualized treatment approach. Goal-directed supportive care remains the bedrock of therapy for all patients, regardless of risk of progression. Sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors and sparsentan should be integral to contemporary supportive care, particularly in patients with chronic kidney damage. Pending the development of reliable biomarkers, it remains a challenge to identify patients prone to progression due to active disease and most likely to derive a net benefit from immunosuppression. The use of clinical parameters, including the degree of proteinuria, the presence of persistent microscopic hematuria, and the rate of eGFR loss, combined with the mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, crescents score, is currently the best approach. Systemic glucocorticoids are indicated in high-risk patients, but the beneficial effects wane after withdrawal and come at the price of substantial treatment-associated toxicity. Therapies with direct effect on disease pathogenesis are increasingly becoming available. While targeted-release budesonide has garnered the most attention, anti-B-cell strategies and selective complement inhibition will most likely prove their added value. We propose a comprehensive approach that tackles the different targets in the pathophysiology of IgA nephropathy according to their relevance in the individual patient.",Yes,,,"[{'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.23678436875343323, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.22408626973628998, 'Cardionephrology': 0.13492539525032043, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.12609997391700745, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.10727818310260773, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.08088338375091553, 'Onconephrology': 0.045794278383255005, 'Blood Purification': 0.04414817690849304}]"
7,"Poisoning occurs after exposure to any of a number of substances, including medicines, which can result in severe toxicity including death. The nephrologist may be involved in poisonings that cause kidney disease and for targeted treatments. The overall approach to the poisoned patient involves the initial acute resuscitation and performing a risk assessment, whereby the exposure is considered in terms of the anticipated severity and in the context of the patient's status and treatments that may be required. Time-critical interventions such as gastrointestinal decontamination ( e.g. , activated charcoal) and antidotes are administered when indicated. The nephrologist is usually involved when elimination enhancement techniques are required, such as urine alkalinization or extracorporeal treatments. There is increasing data to guide decision making for the use of extracorporeal treatments in the poisoned patient. Principles to consider are clinical indications such as whether severe toxicity is present, anticipated, and/or will persist and whether the poison will be significantly removed by the extracorporeal treatment. Extracorporeal clearance is maximized for low-molecular weight drugs that are water soluble with minimal protein binding (<80%) and low endogenous clearance and volume of distribution. The dosage of some antidotes ( e.g. , N-acetylcysteine, ethanol, fomepizole) should be increased to maintain therapeutic concentrations once the extracorporeal treatment is initiated. To maximize the effect of an extracorporeal treatment, blood and effluent flows should be optimized, the filter with the largest surface area selected, and duration tailored to remove enough poison to reduce toxicity. Intermittent hemodialysis is recommended in most cases when an extracorporeal treatment is required because it is the most efficient, and continuous kidney replacement therapy is prescribed in some circumstances, particularly if intermittent hemodialysis is not readily available.",Yes,,,"[{'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.8799154758453369, 'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.05234663188457489, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.022287767380475998, 'Blood Purification': 0.017155194655060768, 'Cardionephrology': 0.012980672530829906, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.0064120180904865265, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.005285855382680893, 'Onconephrology': 0.003616421716287732}]"
8,"Fatigue surrounding hemodialysis treatments is a common and often debilitating symptom that impacts patients' quality of life. Intradialytic fatigue develops or worsens immediately before hemodialysis and persists through the dialysis treatment. Little is known about associated risk factors or pathophysiology, although it may relate to a classic conditioning response. Postdialysis fatigue (PDF) develops or worsens after hemodialysis and may persist for hours. There is no consensus on how to measure PDF. Estimates for the prevalence of PDF range from 20%-86%, likely due to variation in methods of ascertainment and participant characteristics. Several hypotheses seek to explain the pathophysiology of PDF, including inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, and osmotic and fluid shifts, but none is currently supported by compelling or consistent data. PDF is associated with several clinical factors, including cardiovascular and hemodynamic effects of the dialysis procedure, laboratory abnormalities, depression, and physical inactivity. Clinical trials have reported hypothesis-generating data about the utility of cold dialysate, frequent dialysis, clearance of large middle molecules, treatment of depression, and exercise as potential treatments. Existing studies are often limited by sample size, lack of a control group, observational design, or short intervention duration. Robust studies are needed to establish the pathophysiology and management of this important symptom.",Yes,,,"[{'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.3636312782764435, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.30559659004211426, 'Cardionephrology': 0.17054764926433563, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.11776334047317505, 'Blood Purification': 0.02306252159178257, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.012156511656939983, 'Onconephrology': 0.004171873442828655, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.0030702308285981417}]"
9,"The American Society of Transplant Surgeons supports efforts to increase the number of organs that are critically needed for patients desperately awaiting transplantation.

12,"Individuals with liver disease are susceptible to pathophysiological derangements that lead to kidney dysfunction. Patients with advanced cirrhosis and acute liver failure (ALF) are at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI).

15,"While the administration of intravenous fluids remains an important treatment, the negative consequences of subsequent fluid overload have raised questions about when and how clinicians should pursue avenues of fluid removal. Decisions regarding fluid removal during critical illness are complex even for patients with preserved kidney function. This article seeks to apply general concepts of fluid management to the care of patients who also require KRT. Because optimal fluid management for any specific patient is likely to change over the course of critical illness, conceptual models using phases of care have been developed. In this review, we will examine the implications of one such model on the use of ultrafiltration during KRT for volume removal in distributive shock. This will also provide a useful lens to re-examine published data of KRT during critical illness. We will highlight recent prospective trials of KRT as well as recent retrospective studies examining ultrafiltration rate and mortality, review the results, and discuss applications and shortcomings of these studies. We also emphasize that current data and techniques suggest that optimal guidelines will not consist of recommendations for or against absolute fluid removal rates but will instead require the development of dynamic protocols involving frequent cycles of reassessment and adjustment of net fluid removal goals.

21,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by kidney cyst formation and progressive kidney function loss. Dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diet have recently emerged as potential strategies to induce metabolic reprogramming and slow ADPKD progression. We review the available evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of these interventions in ADPKD. Dietary interventions show promise in managing ADPKD by improving metabolic health and reducing oxidative stress. However, while preclinical studies have shown favorable outcomes, limited clinical evidence supports their effectiveness. In addition, the long-term consequences of these dietary interventions, including their effect on adverse events in patients with ADPKD, remain uncertain. To optimize ADPKD management, patients are advised to follow a dietary regimen that aims to achieve or maintain an ideal body weight and includes high fluid intake, low sodium, and limited concentrated sweets. Caloric restriction seems particularly beneficial for patients with overweight or obesity because it promotes weight loss and improves metabolic parameters. Supplementation with curcumin, ginkgolide B, saponins, vitamin E, niacinamide, or triptolide has demonstrated uncertain clinical benefit in patients with ADPKD. Notably, β -hydroxybutyrate supplements have shown promise in animal models; however, their safety and efficacy in ADPKD require further evaluation through well-designed clinical trials. Therefore, the use of these supplements is not currently recommended for patients with ADPKD. In summary, dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diet hold promise in ADPKD management by enhancing metabolic health. However, extensive clinical research is necessary to establish their effectiveness and long-term effects. Adhering to personalized dietary guidelines, including weight management and specific nutritional restrictions, can contribute to optimal ADPKD management. Future research should prioritize well-designed clinical trials to determine the benefits and safety of dietary interventions and supplementation in ADPKD.",Yes,,,"[{'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.2763268053531647, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.2526853084564209, 'Cardionephrology': 0.20832818746566772, 'Onconephrology': 0.15140266716480255, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.07326507568359375, 'Blood Purification': 0.01657191663980484, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.011602762155234814, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.009817276149988174}]"
22,"Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is prone to occur after kidney transplantation, leading to delayed graft function (DGF). MicroRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury, and miR-20a-5p was found to be the most significantly upregulated gene in a DGF patient cohort. However, the roles of microRNAs in transplanted kidneys remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that miR-20a-5p was upregulated in the kidneys of acute kidney injury mice and in patients with DGF. We identified early growth response-1 as a critical upstream target and verified the binding of early growth response-1 to a predicted sequence in the promoter region of the miR-20a-5p gene. Functionally, the miR-20a-5p mimic attenuated IRI and postischemic renal fibrosis, whereas the miR-20a-5p inhibitor delivery aggravated IRI and fibrosis. Importantly, delivery of the miR-20a-5p mimic or inhibitor in the donor kidneys attenuated or aggravated renal loss and structural damage in cold storage transplantation injury. Furthermore, our study identified miR-20a-5p as a negative regulator of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) by targeting the 3' untranslated region of ACSL4 mRNA, thereby inhibiting ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis.

28,"Concerns about hyperkalemia may result in the underuse of established and novel therapies that improve kidney and/or cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hyperkalemia-related issues are of particular relevance in patients with CKD, who are commonly receiving other hyperkalemia-inducing agents such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. In contrast, sodium/glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors mitigate the risk of serious hyperkalemia in clinical trials. We aim to review recent evidence surrounding the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with T2DM and CKD treated with established and novel therapies for diabetic kidney disease, focusing on SGLT2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. We conclude that SGLT2 inhibitors can be used safely in patients with T2DM at high CV risk with CKD without increasing the risk of hyperkalemia. Routine potassium monitoring is generally required when finerenone is used as a kidney- and CV-protective agent in patients with T2DM. Based on existing data, when added to the standard of care, combining SGLT2 inhibitors with finerenone is safe and has the potential to exert additional cardiorenal benefits in patients with diabetic kidney disease. The use of potassium binders should be considered to enable optimal doses of guideline-based therapies for patients with diabetic kidney disease to maximize the kidney and CV benefits.",Yes,,,"[{'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.4489915370941162, 'Cardionephrology': 0.2884025275707245, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.07325123250484467, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.04959102347493172, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.04002438858151436, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.037497032433748245, 'Onconephrology': 0.031343210488557816, 'Blood Purification': 0.030899016186594963}]"

Results Of 13,023 participants, 890 (7%) had stage 4 CKD. The hazard ratio for risk of cardiovascular composite outcome with finerenone versus placebo was 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.57-1.07). The kidney composite outcome proportional hazards assumption was not met for the overall study period, with a protective effect only shown up to 2 years, after which the direction of association was inconsistent and an observed loss of precision over time incurred on finerenone versus placebo risk differences. Nonetheless, albuminuria and rate of eGFR decline were consistently reduced with finerenone versus placebo. Adverse events were balanced between treatment arms. Hyperkalemia was the most common AE reported (stage 4 CKD: 26% and 13% for finerenone versus placebo, respectively) however, the incidence of hyperkalemia leading to permanent discontinuation was low (stage 4 CKD: 3% and 2% for finerenone versus placebo, respectively). Conclusions The cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD were consistent with the overall FIDELITY population; this was also the case for albuminuria and the rate of eGFR decline. The effects on the composite kidney outcome were not consistent over time.",Yes,,,"[{'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.44606778025627136, 'Cardionephrology': 0.4281817376613617, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.05066312849521637, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.0354657880961895, 'Blood Purification': 0.013821708038449287, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.010386751033365726, 'Onconephrology': 0.009098198264837265, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.006314920261502266}]"

59,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) enables people to have a home-based therapy, permitting greater autonomy for individuals along with enhanced treatment satisfaction compared with in-center dialysis care. The burden of treatment on PD, however, remains considerable and underpins the need for person-centered care. This reflects the need to address the patient as a person with needs and preferences beyond just the medical perspective. Shared decision making is central to the recent International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommendations for prescribing PD, balancing the potential benefits of PD on patient well-being with the burden associated with treatment. This review considers the role of high-quality goal-directed prescribing, incremental dialysis, and remote patient monitoring in reducing the burden of dialysis, including an approach to implementing incremental PD. Although patient-related outcomes are important in assessing the response to treatment and, particularly life participation, the corollary of dialysis burden, there are no clear routes to the clinical implementation of patient-related outcome measures.

We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database (2006-2019) and developed the lung donor (LUNDON) acceptability score. A total of 83 219 brain-dead donors were included and were randomly divided into derivation (n = 58 314, 70%) and validation (n = 24 905, 30%) cohorts. The overall lung acceptance was 27.3% (n = 22 767). Donor factors associated with the lung acceptance were age, maximum creatinine, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, mechanism of death by asphyxiation or drowning, history of cigarette use (≥20 pack-years), history of myocardial infarction, chest x-ray appearance, bloodstream infection, and the occurrence of cardiac arrest after brain death. The prediction model had high discriminatory power (C statistic, 0.891; 95% confidence interval, 0.886-0.895) in the validation cohort. We developed a web-based, user-friendly tool (available at https://sites.wustl.edu/lundon) that provides the predicted probability of donor lung acceptance.

In preclinical models and clinical trials, we showed that infusing high numbers of regulatory T cells reduces graft-versus-host disease incidence. Despite no change in in vitro suppressive function, transfer of ex vivo expanded regulatory T cells transduced to overexpress G protein-coupled receptor 15 or C-C motif chemokine receptor 9, specific homing receptors for colon or small intestine, respectively, lessened graft-versus-host disease severity in mice. Increased regulatory T cell frequency and retention within the gastrointestinal tissues of mice that received gut homing T cells correlated with lower inflammation and gut damage early post-transplant, decreased graft-versus-host disease severity, and prolonged survival compared with those receiving control transduced regulatory T cells.

97,"Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is a vital, supportive treatment for patients with critical illness and severe AKI. The optimal timing, dose, and modality of KRT have been studied extensively, but gaps in knowledge remain. With respect to modalities, continuous KRT and intermittent hemodialysis are well-established options, but prolonged intermittent KRT is becoming more prevalent worldwide, particularly in emerging countries. Compared with continuous KRT, prolonged intermittent KRT offers similar hemodynamic stability and overall cost savings, and its intermittent nature allows patients time off therapy for mobilization and procedures. When compared with intermittent hemodialysis, prolonged intermittent KRT offers more hemodynamic stability, particularly in patients who remain highly vulnerable to hypotension from aggressive ultrafiltration over a shorter duration of treatment. The prescription of prolonged intermittent KRT can be tailored to patients' progression in their recovery from critical illness, and the frequency, flow rates, and duration of treatment can be modified to avert hemodynamic instability during de-escalation of care. Dosing of prolonged intermittent KRT can be extrapolated from urea kinetics used to calculate clearance for continuous KRT and intermittent hemodialysis. Practice variations across institutions with respect to terminology, prescription, and dosing of prolonged intermittent KRT create significant challenges, especially in creating specific drug dosing recommendations during prolonged intermittent KRT. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, prolonged intermittent KRT was rapidly implemented to meet the KRT demands during patient surges in some of the medical centers overwhelmed by sheer volume of patients with AKI. Ideally, implementation of prolonged intermittent KRT at any institution should be conducted in a timely manner, with judicious planning and collaboration among nephrology, critical care, dialysis and intensive care nursing, and pharmacy leadership.

103,"Progress in pig organ xenotransplantation has been made largely through (1) genetic engineering of the organ-source pig to protect its tissues from the human innate immune response, and (2) development of an immunosuppressive regimen based on blockade of the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway to prevent the adaptive immune response. In the 1980s, after transplantation into nonhuman primates (NHPs), wild-type (genetically unmodified) pig organs were rejected within minutes or hours. In the 1990s, organs from pigs expressing a human complement-regulatory protein (CD55) transplanted into NHPs receiving intensive conventional immunosuppressive therapy functioned for days or weeks. When costimulation blockade was introduced in 2000, the adaptive immune response was suppressed more readily. The identification of galactose-α1,3-galactose as the major antigen target for human and NHP anti-pig antibodies in 1991 allowed for deletion of expression of galactose-α1,3-galactose in 2003, extending pig graft survival for up to 6 months. Subsequent gene editing to overcome molecular incompatibilities between the pig and primate coagulation systems proved additionally beneficial.

109,"Nutritional epidemiology seeks to understand nutritional determinants of disease in human populations using experimental and observational study designs. Though randomized controlled trials provide the strongest evidence of causality, the expense and difficulty of sustaining adherence to dietary interventions are substantial barriers to investigating dietary determinants of kidney disease. Therefore, nutritional epidemiology commonly employs observational study designs, particularly prospective cohort studies, to investigate long-term associations between dietary exposures and kidney disease. Due to the covarying nature and synergistic effects of dietary components, holistic characterizations of dietary exposures that simultaneously consider patterns of foods and nutrients regularly consumed are generally more relevant to disease etiology than single nutrients or foods. Dietary intakes have traditionally been self-reported and are subject to bias. Statistical methods including energy adjustment and regression calibration can reduce random and systematic measurement errors associated with self-reported diet. Novel approaches that assess diet more objectively are gaining popularity but have not yet fully replaced self-report and require refinement and validation in populations with chronic kidney disease. More accurate and frequent diet assessment in existing and future studies will yield evidence to better personalize dietary recommendations for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.",Yes,,,"[{'Glomerular Disease': 0.37112367153167725, 'Cardionephrology': 0.15520870685577393, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.14895190298557281, 'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.1031235083937645, 'Onconephrology': 0.0754169300198555, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.0494810976088047, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.048349324613809586, 'Blood Purification': 0.04834485054016113}]"

112,"In clinical organ transplantation, donor and recipient ages may differ substantially. Old donor organs accumulate senescent cells that have the capacity to induce senescence in naïve cells. We hypothesized that the engraftment of old organs may induce senescence in younger recipients, promoting age-related pathologies. When performing isogeneic cardiac transplants between age-mismatched C57BL/6 old donor (18 months) mice and young and middle-aged C57BL/6 (3- or 12- month-old) recipients , we observed augmented frequencies of senescent cells in draining lymph nodes, adipose tissue, livers, and hindlimb muscles 30 days after transplantation. These observations went along with compromised physical performance and impaired spatial learning and memory abilities. Systemic levels of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, including mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), were elevated in recipients. Of mechanistic relevance, injections of mt-DNA phenocopied effects of age-mismatched organ transplantation on accelerating aging. Single treatment of old donor animals with senolytics prior to transplantation attenuated mt-DNA release and improved physical capacities in young recipients.

131,"For decades, transplantation has been a life-saving treatment for those fortunate enough to gain access. Nevertheless, many patients die waiting for an organ and countless more never make it onto the waitlist because of a shortage of donor organs. Concurrently, thousands of donated organs are declined for transplant each year because of concerns about poor outcomes post-transplant. The decline of any donated organ-even if medically justified-is tragic for both the donor family and potential recipients. In this Personal Viewpoint, we discuss the need for a new mindset in how we honor the gift of organ donation. We believe that the use of transplant-declined human organs in translational research has the potential to hasten breakthrough discoveries in a multitude of scientific and medical areas. More importantly, such breakthroughs will allow us to properly value every donated organ. We further discuss the many practical challenges that such research presents and offer some possible solutions based on experiences in our own research laboratories.

132,"Belatacept-based immunosuppression in kidney transplantation confers fewer off-target toxicities than calcineurin inhibitors but comes at a cost of increased incidence and severity of acute rejection, potentially due to its deleterious effect on both the number and function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs). TIGIT is a CD28 family coinhibitory receptor expressed on several subsets of immune cells including Tregs. We hypothesized that coinhibition through TIGIT signaling could function to ameliorate costimulation blockade-resistant rejection. The results demonstrate that treatment with an agonistic anti-TIGIT antibody, when combined with costimulation blockade by CTLA-4Ig, can prolong allograft survival in a murine skin graft model compared with CTLA-4Ig alone. Further, this prolongation of graft survival is accompanied by an increase in the frequency and number of graft-infiltrating Tregs and a concomitant reduction in the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the graft. Through the use of Treg-specific TIGIT conditional knockout animals, we demonstrated that the TIGIT-mediated reduction in the graft-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response is dependent on signaling of TIGIT on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs.

145,"There is widespread interest in expanding the uptake of home dialysis in North America. Although kidney transplantation should be the preferred option in eligible patients, home hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) offer cost-effective options for KRT. In this review, the motivation for promoting home dialysis is presented, and the literature supporting it is critically reviewed. Randomized comparisons of home HD and PD with in-center HD have been challenging to conduct and provide only limited information. Nonrandomized studies are heterogeneous in their design and have often yielded conflicting results. They are prone to bias, and this must be carefully considered when evaluating this literature. Home modalities seem to have equivalent clinical outcomes and quality of life when compared with in-center HD.

157,"Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive drug that is widely used in the postsurgery management of transplantation. To date, the mechanism by which rapamycin reduces posttransplant neovascularization has not been fully understood. Given the original avascularity and immune privilege of the cornea, corneal transplantation is considered as an ideal model to investigate neovascularization and its effects on allograft rejection. Previously, we found that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) prolong corneal allograft survival through suppression of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Here, we show that depletion of MDSC abolished rapamycin-mediated suppression of neovascularization and elongation of corneal allograft survival. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that rapamycin dramatically enhanced the expression of arginase 1 (Arg1). Furthermore, an Arg1 inhibitor also completely abolished the rapamycin-mediated beneficial effects after corneal transplantation.

Plasma secretin levels increase during acute alkalosis, and the secretin receptor (SCTR) is functionally expressed in β -ICs.

To study this, we screened for anti-HLA antibodies in a prospectively enrolled cohort of 49 patients who received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CARTx), targeting naïve and memory B cells (CD19-targeted, n = 21) or plasma cells (BCMA-targeted, n = 28) for hematologic malignancies.

169,"Vitamin K deficiency is common among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and likely contributes to progressive vascular calcification and stiffness. In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin K supplementation on the primary end point, serum calcification propensity (calciprotein particle maturation time, T50), and secondary end points arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and vitamin K status in 40 vitamin K-deficient KTRs (plasma dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein [dp-ucMGP] ≥500 pmol/L). Participants (35% female; age, 57 ± 13 years) were randomized 1:1 to vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7, 360 μg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Vitamin K supplementation had no effect on calcification propensity (change in T50 vs baseline +2.3 ± 27.4 minutes) compared with placebo (+0.8 ± 34.4 minutes; P<sub>between group</sub> = .88) but prevented progression of PWV (change vs baseline -0.06 ± 0.26 m/s) compared with placebo (+0.27 ± 0.43 m/s; P<sub>between group</sub> = .010). Vitamin K supplementation strongly improved vitamin K status (change in dp-ucMGP vs baseline -385 [-631 to -269] pmol/L) compared with placebo (+39 [-188 to +183] pmol/L; P<sub>between group</sub> < .001), although most patients remained vitamin K-deficient. In conclusion, vitamin K supplementation did not alter serum calcification propensity but prevented progression of arterial stiffness, suggesting that vitamin K has vascular effects independent of calciprotein particles. These results set the stage for longer-term intervention studies with vitamin K supplementation in KTRs.

Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI has shown inconsistent associations with kidney damage markers but has been predictive of kidney function decline in several studies.

The basolateral reabsorptive urate transporter GLUT9a appears to be the dominant target for insulin. By contrast, IGF-1 infusion reduces serum urate (SU), through mechanisms unknown. Genetic variants of IGF1R associated with reduced SU have increased IGF-1R expression and interact with genes encoding the GLUT9 and ABCG2 urate transporters, in a sex-specific fashion, which controls the SU level. Activation of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling in Xenopus oocytes modestly activates GLUT9a and inhibits insulin's stimulatory effect on the transporter, which also activates multiple secretory urate transporters-ABCG2, ABCC4, OAT1, and OAT3. The results collectively suggest that IGF-1 reduces SU by activating secretory urate transporters and inhibiting insulin's action on GLUT9a.",Yes,,,"[{'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.20436270534992218, 'Cardionephrology': 0.19792789220809937, 'Onconephrology': 0.1454014927148819, 'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.1400076150894165, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.10193055868148804, 'Blood Purification': 0.09799416363239288, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.06261280179023743, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.04976276680827141}]"

The included articles reported varicella vaccine administration in the posttransplant period in children and adults. A pooled proportion of transplant recipients who seroconverted and who developed vaccine-strain varicella and varicella disease was generated. Eighteen articles (14 observational studies and 4 case reports) were included, reporting on 711 transplant recipients who received the varicella vaccine. The pooled proportion was 88.2% (95% confidence interval 78.0%-96.0%, 13 studies) for vaccinees who seroconverted, 0% (0%-1.2%, 13 studies) for vaccine-strain varicella, and 0.8% (0%-4.9%, 9 studies) for varicella disease. Most studies followed clinical guidelines for administering live-attenuated vaccines, with criteria that could include being at least 1 year posttransplant, 2 months postrejection episode, and on low-dose immunosuppressive medications. Varicella vaccination in transplant recipients was overall safe in the included studies, with few cases of vaccine-strain-induced varicella or vaccine failure, and although it was immunogenic, the proportion of recipients who seroconverted was lower than that seen in the general population.

191,"Acute rejection (AR) is an important factor that leads to poor prognosis after liver transplantation (LT). Macrophage M1-polarization is an important mechanism in AR development. MicroRNAs play vital roles in disease regulation; however, their effects on macrophages and AR remain unclear. In this study, rat models of AR were established following LT, and macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from rats and humans, respectively. We found miR-449a expression to be significantly reduced in macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Overexpression of miR-449a not only inhibited the M1-polarization of macrophages in vitro but also improved the AR of transplant in vivo. The mechanism involved inhibiting the noncanonical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathway. We identified procollagen-lysine1,2-oxoglutarate5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) as a target gene of miR-449a, which could reverse miR-449a's inhibition of macrophage M1-polarization, amelioration of AR, and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Overall, miR-449a inhibited the NF-κB pathway in macrophages through PLOD1 and also inhibited the M1-polarization of macrophages, thus attenuating AR after LT.

197,"In lung transplantation, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) diagnosed using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria is uncommon compared with other organs, and previous studies failed to find molecular AMR (ABMR) in lung biopsies.

We therefore searched for a similar molecular ABMR-like state in transbronchial biopsies using gene expression microarray results from the INTERLUNG study (#NCT02812290). After optimizing rejection-selective transcript sets in a training set (N = 488), the resulting algorithms separated an NK cell-enriched molecular rejection-like state (NKRL) from T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR)/Mixed in a test set (N = 488). Applying this approach to all 896 transbronchial biopsies distinguished 3 groups: no rejection, TCMR/Mixed, and NKRL. Like TCMR/Mixed, NKRL had increased expression of all-rejection transcripts, but NKRL had increased expression of NK cell transcripts, whereas TCMR/Mixed had increased effector T cell and activated macrophage transcripts. NKRL was usually DSA-negative and not recognized as AMR clinically. TCMR/Mixed was associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction, reduced one-second forced expiratory volume at the time of biopsy, and short-term graft failure, but NKRL was not.

204,"Because of the breadth of factors that might affect kidney transplant decisions to accept an organ or wait for another, presumably ""better"" offer, a high degree of heterogeneity in decision making exists among transplant surgeons and hospitals. These decisions do not typically include objective predictions regarding the future availability of equivalent or better-quality organs or the likelihood of patient death while waiting for another organ. To investigate the impact of displaying such predictions on organ donation decision making, we conducted a statistically designed experiment involving 53 kidney transplant professionals, in which kidney offers were presented via an online application and systematically altered to observe the effects on decision making. We found that providing predictive analytics for time-to-better offers and patient mortality improved decision consensus and decision-maker confidence in their decisions. Providing a visual display of the patient's mortality slope under accept/reject conditions shortened the time-to-decide but did not have an impact on the decision itself.

208,"Two of the greatest challenges facing kidney transplantation are the lack of donated organs and inequities in who receives a transplant. Xenotransplantation holds promise as a treatment approach that could solve the supply problem. Major advances in gene-editing procedures have enabled several companies to raise genetically engineered pigs for organ donation. These porcine organs lack antigens and have other modifications that should reduce the probability of immunological rejection when transplanted into humans. The US Food and Drug Administration and transplantation leaders are starting to chart a path to test xenotransplants in clinical trials and later integrate them into routine clinical care. Here we provide a framework that industry, regulatory authorities, payers, transplantation professionals, and patient groups can implement to promote equity during every stage in this process. We also call for immediate action. Companies developing xenotransplant technology should assemble patient advocacy boards to bring the concerns of individuals with end-stage kidney disease to the forefront. For trials, xenotransplantation companies should partner with transplant programs with substantial patient populations of racial and ethnic minority groups and that have reciprocal relationships with those communities.

216,"This large observational cohort study aimed to investigate the relationship between dialysate and plasma sodium concentrations and mortality among maintenance hemodialysis patients. Using a large multinational cohort of 68,196 patients, we found that lower dialysate sodium concentrations (≤138 mmol/L) were independently associated with higher mortality compared with higher dialysate sodium concentrations (>138 mmol/L). The risk of death was lower among patients exposed to higher dialysate sodium concentrations, regardless of plasma sodium levels. These results challenge the prevailing assumption that lower dialysate sodium concentrations improve outcomes in hemodialysis patients.

220,"Climate change is upon us, and it will have a major effect on both kidney disease and the nephrology practice. But the converse is also true: our treatment of kidney disease has an effect on the climate. Much attention has focused on how rising temperatures can lead to acute and CKD and health exacerbations in patients with established kidney disease. Climate change is also associated with rising air pollution from wildfires and industrial wastes and infectious diseases associated with flooding and changing habitats, all of which heighten the risk of acute and CKD. Less well recognized or understood are the ways nephrology practices, in turn, contribute to still more climate change. Hemodialysis, although lifesaving, can be associated with marked water usage (up to 600 L per dialysis session), energy usage (with one 4-hour session averaging as much as one fifth of the total energy consumed by a household per day), and large clinical wastes (with hemodialysis accounting for one third of total clinical medicine-associated waste). Of note, >90% of dialysis occurs in highly affluent countries, whereas dialysis is much less available in the poorer countries where climate change is having the highest effect on kidney disease.

This finding was not driven by an ""osmotic diuretic"" effect; however, several parameters changed in a manner consistent with inhibition of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3. The large changes in proximal tubular handling were acutely buffered by increased reabsorption in both the loop of Henle and the distal nephron, resulting in the observed modest acute natriuresis with these agents.

Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics (including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes) of 3,218 adults aged ≥60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022-June 2023. Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged ≥75 years, and the most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%-21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged ≥60 years. Overall, 17.0% (95% CI = 14.5%-19.7%) of patients with RSV infection were admitted to an intensive care unit, 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5%-6.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 4.7% (95% CI = 3.6%-6.1%) died; 17.2% (95% CI = 14.9%-19.8%) of all cases occurred in long-term care facility residents. These data highlight the importance of prioritizing those at highest risk for severe RSV disease and suggest that clinicians and patients consider age (particularly age ≥75 years), long-term care facility residence, and underlying medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure, in shared clinical decision-making when offering RSV vaccine to adults aged ≥60 years.",,,,Uncategorizable
251,"Heart transplant and recipient survival are limited by immune cell-mediated injury of the graft vasculature. We examined the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-β (PI3Kβ) isoform in endothelial cells (EC) during coronary vascular immune injury and repair in mice. In minor histocompatibility-antigen mismatched allogeneic heart grafts, a robust immune response was mounted to each wild-type, PI3Kβ inhibitor-treated, or endothelial-selective PI3Kβ knockout (ECβKO) graft transplanted to wild-type recipients. However, microvascular EC loss and progressive occlusive vasculopathy only developed in control, but not PI3Kβ-inactivated hearts. We observed a delay in inflammatory cell infiltration of the ECβKO grafts, particularly in the coronary arteries. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by an impaired display of proinflammatory chemokine and adhesion molecules by the ECβKO ECs. In vitro, tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated endothelial ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression was blocked by PI3Kβ inhibition or RNA interference. Selective PI3Kβ inhibition also blocked tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa Bα and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 in EC.

252,"The association between cardiac and kidney dysfunction has received attention over the past two decades. A putatively unique syndrome, the cardiorenal syndrome, distinguishing five subtypes on the basis of the chronology of cardiac and kidney events, has been widely adopted. This review discusses the methodologic and practical problems inherent to the current classification of cardiorenal syndrome. The term ""disorder"" is more appropriate than the term ""syndrome"" to describe concomitant cardiovascular and kidney dysfunction and/or damage. Indeed, the term disorder designates a disruption induced by disease states to the normal function of organs or organ systems. We apply Occam's razor to the chronology-based construct to arrive at a simple definition on the basis of the coexistence of cardiovascular disease and CKD, the chronic cardiovascular-kidney disorder (CCKD). This conceptual framework builds upon the fact that cardiovascular and CKD share common risk factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms. Biological changes set in motion by kidney dysfunction accelerate cardiovascular disease progression and vice versa . Depending on various combinations of risk factors and precipitating conditions, patients with CCKD may present initially with cardiovascular disease or with hallmarks of CKD. Treatment targeting cardiovascular or kidney dysfunction may improve the outcomes of both. The portfolio of interventions targeting the kidney-cardiovascular continuum is in an expanding phase. In the medium term, applying the new omics sciences may unravel new therapeutic targets and further improve the therapy of CCKD. Trials based on cardiovascular and kidney composite end points are an attractive and growing area. Targeting pathways common to cardiovascular and kidney diseases will help prevent the adverse health effects of CCKD.",Yes,,,"[{'Cardionephrology': 0.5444045066833496, 'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.27223145961761475, 'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.07049373537302017, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.02904611825942993, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.02757515385746956, 'Onconephrology': 0.022403793409466743, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.019009802490472794, 'Blood Purification': 0.014835392124950886}]"

265,"Intermittent hemodialysis remains a cornerstone of extracorporeal KRT in the intensive care unit, either as a first-line therapy for AKI or a second-line therapy when patients transition from a continuous or prolonged intermittent therapy. Intermittent hemodialysis is usually provided 3 days per week in this setting on the basis that no clinical benefits have been demonstrated with more frequent hemodialysis. This should not detract from the importance of continually assessing and refining the hemodialysis prescription (including the need for extra treatments) according to dynamic changes in extracellular volume and other parameters, and ensuring that an adequate dose of hemodialysis is being delivered to the patient. Compared with other KRT modalities, the cardinal challenge encountered during intermittent hemodialysis is hemodynamic instability. This phenomenon occurs when reductions in intravascular volume, as a consequence of ultrafiltration and/or osmotic shifts, outpace compensatory plasma refilling from the extravascular space. Myocardial stunning, triggered by intermittent hemodialysis, and independent of ultrafiltration, may also contribute. The hemodynamic effect of intermittent hemodialysis is likely magnified in patients who are critically ill due to an inability to mount sufficient compensatory physiologic responses in the context of multiorgan dysfunction. Of the many interventions that have undergone testing to mitigate hemodynamic instability related to KRT, the best evidence exists for cooling the dialysate and raising the dialysate sodium concentration. Unfortunately, the evidence supporting routine use of these and other interventions is weak owing to poor study quality and limited sample sizes. Intermittent hemodialysis will continue to be an important and commonly used KRT modality for AKI in patients with critical illness, especially in jurisdictions where resources are limited. There is an urgent need to harmonize the definition of hemodynamic instability related to KRT in clinical trials and robustly test strategies to combat it in this vulnerable patient population.",Yes,,,"[{'Critical Care in Nephrology': 0.5760822892189026, 'Kidney Transplantation': 0.339457243680954, 'Cardionephrology': 0.06855982542037964, 'Clinical Research in Nephrology': 0.005856780335307121, 'Blood Purification': 0.003991750534623861, 'Glomerular Disease': 0.00350610027089715, 'Onconephrology': 0.0017125754384323955, 'Pediatric Nephrology': 0.0008334534941241145}]"
266,"The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, an arm of the Health Resources and Services Administration, has a contract with the United Network for Organ Sharing since 1986 to provide central oversight of organ donation and transplants in the United States. The United Network for Organ Sharing has recently come under scrutiny, prompting a review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine as summarized in its recent report and also by the US Senate Finance Committee. The national news services have opined about organ donation ethics, access to transplantation particularly for medically underserved populations, and management of organ transplantation data. These critiques raise important concerns that deserve our best response as a transplant community. Broadly, we suggest that the data management approach of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network be replaced with a patient-centric omnichannel network in which all donor and recipient data exist in a single longitudinal record that can be used by all applications. A more comprehensive and standardized approach to donor data collection would drive quality improvement across organ procurement organizations and help address inequities in transplantation.

267,"Enteric hyperoxaluria is a medical condition characterized by elevated urinary oxalate excretion due to increased gastrointestinal oxalate absorption. Causative features include fat malabsorption and/or increased intestinal permeability to oxalate. Enteric hyperoxaluria has long been known to cause nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, and, more recently, an association with CKD and kidney failure has been shown. Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for enteric hyperoxaluria, and it is unclear what end points should be used to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs and biologics for this condition. This study represents work of a multidisciplinary group convened by the Kidney Health Initiative to review the evidence supporting potential end points for clinical trials in enteric hyperoxaluria. A potential clinical outcome is symptomatic kidney stone events. Potential surrogate end points include ( 1 ) an irreversible loss of kidney function as a surrogate for progression to kidney failure, ( 2 ) asymptomatic kidney stone growth/new stone formation observed on imaging as a surrogate for symptomatic kidney stone events, ( 3 ) urinary oxalate and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation as surrogates for the development of symptomatic kidney stone events, and ( 4) plasma oxalate as a surrogate for the development of the clinical manifestations of systemic oxalosis.

271,"All vitamins play essential roles in various aspects of body function and systems. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those receiving dialysis, may be at increased risk of developing vitamin deficiencies due to anorexia, poor dietary intake, protein energy wasting, restricted diet, dialysis loss, or inadequate sun exposure for vitamin D. However, clinical manifestations of most vitamin deficiencies are usually subtle or undetected in this population. Testing for circulating levels is not undertaken for most vitamins except folate, B<sub>12</sub>, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D because assays may not be available or may be costly to perform and do not always correlate with body stores. The last systematic review through 2016 was performed for the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2020 Nutrition Guideline update, so this article summarizes the more recent evidence. We review the use of vitamins supplementation in the CKD population. To date there have been no randomized trials to support the benefits of any vitamin supplementation for kidney, cardiovascular, or patient-centered outcomes. The decision to supplement water-soluble vitamins should be individualized, taking account the patient's dietary intake, nutritional status, risk of vitamins deficiency/insufficiency, CKD stage, comorbid status, and dialysis loss. Nutritional vitamin D deficiency should be corrected, but the supplementation dose and formulation need to be personalized, taking into consideration the degree of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, parathyroid hormone levels, CKD stage, and local formulation. Routine supplementation of vitamins A and E is not supported due to potential toxicity.

We used the Optum deidentified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset to identify individuals with CKD stages 4 or 5 who transitioned to dialysis. We searched structured data elements from clinical notes, identified by natural language processing, for symptoms recorded across weekly intervals in the 6 months before and after dialysis initiation and estimated changes in the odds of a symptom being recorded with an interrupted time series analysis using segmented logistic regression. The cohort comprised 728 individuals (aged 68±13 years, 44% women, 56% White, 30% Black). Before dialysis initiation, 83% were recorded as having pain, 68% fatigue/weakness, 66% shortness of breath, 61% nausea/vomiting, and 37% difficulty concentrating. Before dialysis initiation, odds of pain being recorded increased (slope: odds ratio [OR] 1.02 per week, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.03); initiation was associated with a decrease (intercept change: OR 0.70, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82). After initiation, odds of pain were unchanged (postdialysis slope: OR 1.00 per week, 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.01), although this represented an improved trajectory relative to the predialysis period (change in slope: OR 0.98 per week, 95% CI, 0.96 to 0.99). For fatigue/weakness, odds increased before initiation (OR 1.03 per week, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.04) but decreased on initiation (OR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.75) and thereafter (OR 0.98 per week, 95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99), representing a reduction in slope (OR 0.95 per week, 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.97). Patterns for shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and difficulty concentrating were similar to those of pain.

279,"There is a broad phenotypic spectrum of monogenic polycystic kidney diseases (PKDs). These disorders often involve cilia-related genes and lead to the development of fluid-filled cysts and eventual kidney function decline and failure. Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic (PGT-M) disorders has moved into the clinical realm. It allows prospective parents to avoid passing on heritable diseases to their children, including monogenic PKD.

There is a growing body of literature supporting the success of PGT-M for autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive PKD, although with important technical limitations in some cases. This technology can be applied to many other types of monogenic PKD and ciliopathies despite the lack of existing reports in the literature. PGT-M for monogenic PKD, like other forms of assisted reproductive technology, raises important ethical questions.

286,"The importance of waitlist (WL) mortality risk estimates will increase with the adoption of the US Composite Allocation Score (CAS) system. Calibration is rarely assessed in clinical prediction models, yet it is a key factor in determining access to lung transplant. We assessed the calibration of the WL-lung allocation score (LAS)/CAS models and developed alternative models to minimize miscalibration. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data from 2015 to 2020 were used to assess the calibration of the WL model and for subgroups (age, sex, diagnosis, and race/ethnicity). Three recalibrated models were developed and compared: (1) simple recalibration model (SRM), (2) weighted recalibration model 1 (WRM1), and (3) weighted recalibration model 2 (WRM2). The current WL-LAS/CAS model underestimated risk for 78% of individuals (predicted mortality risk, <42%) and overpredicted risk for 22% of individuals (predicted mortality risk, ≥42%), with divergent results among subgroups. Error measures improved in SRM, WRM1, and WRM2. SRM generally preserved candidate rankings, whereas WRM1 and WRM2 led to changes in ranking by age and diagnosis. Differential miscalibration occurred in the WL-LAS/CAS model, which improved with recalibration measures. Further inquiry is needed to develop mortality models in which risk predictions approximate observed data to ensure accurate ranking and timely access to transplant. IMPACT: With changes to the lung transplant allocation system planned in 2023, evaluation of the accuracy and precision of survival models used to rank candidates for lung transplant is important. The waitlist model underpredicts risk for 78% of US transplant candidates with an unequal distribution of miscalibration across subgroups leading to inaccurate ranking of transplant candidates.

The past decade has seen an increased number of efforts to develop minimally invasive procedures for monitoring allograft injury.

The addition of the LKDPI to reference models based on recipient variables increased the C statistic by only 0.02.

308,"AKI occurs frequently in critically ill patients. Patients with AKI, including those who require KRT, experience multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic perturbations that dynamically influence medication effectiveness and safety. Patients with AKI may experience both subtherapeutic drug concentrations, which lead to ineffective therapy, and supratherapeutic drug concentrations, which increase the risk for toxicity. In critically ill patients with AKI not requiring KRT, conventional GFR estimation equations, especially those based on serum creatinine, have several limitations that can limit the accuracy when used for medication dosing. Alternative methods to estimate kidney function may be informative, including use of measured urinary creatinine clearance, kinetic eGFR, and equations that integrate novel kidney biomarkers. For critically ill patients with AKI requiring KRT, physicochemical properties of the drug, the KRT prescription and circuit configuration, and patient-specific factors each contribute to medication clearance. Evidence-based guidance for medication dosing during AKI requiring KRT is often limited. A working knowledge of the basic tenets of drug elimination during KRT can provide a framework for how to approach decision making when the literature is lacking.

Limited specific data are available on the zoonotic potential of pig pathogens. It is anticipated that the risk of zoonotic infection in xenograft recipients will be determined by organisms present in source animals and relate to the nature and intensity of the immunosuppression used to maintain xenograft function. Based on experience in allotransplantation and with preclinical models, viral infections are of greatest concern, including porcine cytomegalovirus, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus, and porcine endogenous retroviruses. Sensitive and specific microbiological assays are required for routine microbiological surveillance of source animals and xenograft recipients. Archiving of blood samples from recipients, contacts, and hospital staff may provide a basis for microbiological investigations if infectious syndromes develop. Carefully implemented infection control practices are required to prevent zoonotic pathogen exposures by clinical care providers.

314,"After pig-to-baboon kidney transplantation, episodes of hypovolemia and hypotension from an unexplained mechanism have been reported.

Kidneys from genetically-engineered pigs were transplanted into 5 immunosuppressed baboons after the excision of the native kidneys. Immunosuppressive therapy was based on the blockade of the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway. Plasma renin, angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone levels, and urine osmolality and electrolytes were measured in healthy pigs, healthy nonimmunosuppressed baboons, and immunosuppressed baboons with life-supporting pig kidney grafts. After pig kidney transplantation, plasma renin and Ang II levels were not significantly different, although Ang II trended lower, even though plasma AGT and potassium were increased. Plasma aldosterone levels were unchanged. Urine osmolality and sodium concentration were decreased. Even in the presence of increasing AGT and potassium levels, lower plasma Ang II concentrations may be because of reduced, albeit not absent, the reactivity of pig renin to cleave baboon AGT, suggesting an impaired response of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to hypovolemic and hypotensive episodes.

We performed a scoping review of studies developing, validating, or updating a prognostic model for patients with CKD. We searched all published models in PubMed and Embase and report predicted outcomes, methodological quality, and validation and/or updating efforts. We found 602 studies, of which 30.1% concerned CKD populations, 31.6% dialysis populations, and 38.4% kidney transplantation populations. The most frequently predicted outcomes were mortality ( n =129), kidney disease progression ( n =75), and kidney graft survival ( n =54).

Our objective was to determine whether an implementation strategy for AHF team members could feasibly contribute to organizational and culture change supporting equity in AHF allocation. Using a pretest-posttest design, the strategy included an 8-week multicomponent training on bias reduction, standardized numerical social assessments, and enhanced group dynamics at an AHF center. Evaluations of organizational and cultural changes included pretest-posttest AHF team member surveys, transcripts of AHF meetings to assess group dynamics using a standardized scoring system, and posttest interviews guided by a framework for implementing a complex strategy. Results were analyzed with qualitative descriptive methods and Brunner-Munzel tests for relative effect (RE, RE >0.5 signals posttest improvement). The majority of survey metrics revealed potential benefit with RE >0.5. REs were >0.5 for 5 of 6 group dynamics metrics.

355,"Use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) with advanced skin cancers presents a significant clinical management dilemma. SOTRs and other immunosuppressed patients have been routinely excluded from ICI clinical trials with good reason: immune checkpoints play an important role in self- and allograft-tolerance and risk of acute allograft rejection reported in retrospective studies affects 10% to 65% of cases. These reports also confirm that cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma respond to ICI therapy, although response rates are generally lower than those observed in immunocompetent populations. Prospective trials are now of critical importance in further establishing ICI efficacy and safety. However, based on current knowledge, we recommend that ICIs should be offered to kidney transplant recipients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma if surgery and/or radiotherapy have failed. For kidney transplant recipients, this should be first line ahead of chemotherapy and targeted therapies. In SOTRs, the use of ICIs should be carefully considered with the benefits of ICIs versus risks of allograft rejection weighed up on a case-by-case basis as part of shared decision-making with patients. In all cases, parallel management of immunosuppression may be key to ICI responsiveness. We recommend maintaining immunosuppression before ICI initiation with a dual immunosuppressive regimen combining mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and either corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Such modification of immunosuppression must be considered in the context of allograft risk (both rejection and also its subsequent treatment) and risk of tumor progression.

357,"Surgical liver failure (SLF) develops when a marginal amount of hepatic mass is left after surgery, such as following excessive resection. SLF is the commonest cause of death due to liver surgery; however, its etiology remains obscure. Using mouse models of standard hepatectomy (sHx) (68%, resulting in full regeneration) or extended hepatectomy (eHx) (86%/91%, causing SLF), we explored the causes of early SLF related to portal hyperafflux. Assessing the levels of HIF2A with or without oxygenating agent inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) indicated hypoxia early after eHx. Subsequently, lipid oxidation (PPARA/PGC1α) was downregulated and associated with persisting steatosis. Mild oxidation with low-dose ITPP reduced the levels of HIF2A, restored downstream PPARA/PGC1α expression along with lipid oxidation activities (LOAs), and normalized steatosis and other metabolic or regenerative SLF deficiencies. Promotion of LOA with L-carnitine likewise normalized the SLF phenotype, and both ITPP and L-carnitine markedly raised survival in lethal SLF. In patients who underwent hepatectomy, pronounced increases in serum carnitine levels (reflecting LOA) were associated with better recovery. Lipid oxidation thus provides a link between the hyperafflux of O<sub>2</sub>-poor portal blood, the metabolic/regenerative deficits, and the increased mortality typifying SLF. Stimulation of lipid oxidation-the prime regenerative energy source-particularly through L-carnitine may offer a safe and feasible way to reduce SLF risks in the clinic.",,,,Uncategorizable

Day 30 spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup>% was negative in 91% KTRs (vs 20% HCs; P = .07), without correlation to anti-RBD (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.17). Day 30 SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR repertoires were detected in 52% KTRs vs 74% HCs (P = .11). Spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> TCR expansion was similar between KTRs and HCs, yet KTR CD8<sup>+</sup> TCR depth was 7.6-fold lower (P = .001). Global negative response was seen in 7% KTRs, associated with high-dose MMF (P = .037); 44% showed global positive response. Of the KTRs, 16% experienced breakthrough infections, with 2 hospitalizations; prebreakthrough variant neutralization was poor. Absent neutralizing and CD8<sup>+</sup> responses in KTRs indicate vulnerability to COVID-19 despite 3-dose mRNA vaccination. Lack of neutralization despite CD4<sup>+</sup> expansion suggests B cell dysfunction and/or ineffective T cell help. Development of more effective KTR vaccine strategies is critical.

Whether the functional properties of these transporters involve HCO3-, CO32-, or HCO3-/CO32- stimulated H+ (or OH-) transport has not received widespread attention in the literature. Accordingly, ""bicarbonate"" is the term typically used in most textbooks without greater specificity. Moreover, clinicians and physiologists have historically focused on the blood HCO3- concentration as the base term in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in the analysis of clinical acid-base abnormalities, thus, bicarbonate has been assumed to be the species reabsorbed along the nephron as required to maintain the blood [HCO3-] at approximately 25 mM.

392,"Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) plays a major role in the treatment of severe AKI. Intermittent hemodialysis (HD) and continuous KRT (CKRT) are the main modalities in critically ill patients with AKI. CKRT is the preferred modality in many countries because of its alleged superiority on both hemodynamic tolerance and on kidney function recovery. In fact, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the two modalities have not shown any actual benefit of one technique over the other on mortality, hemodynamics, or kidney function recovery. Those RCTs were conducted more than 15 years ago. Major progress was eventually made leading to much lower mortality rates in recent studies than in previous studies. In addition, those RCTs included a noticeable proportion of patients who could have recovered without ever receiving KRT, as demonstrated by several recent studies. In the absence of evidence of clinical superiority of one KRT modality, the choice must be addressed not only regarding clinical outcome but also resources and logistics. Conclusions of health technology assessments and study reports were heterogeneous and conflicting concerning cost-effectiveness of intermittent HD versus CKRT.

This has major public health implications in South Asia and in other parts of the world to where South Asians have immigrated. The interplay of various modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors confers this risk. Traditional models of cardiometabolic disease progression and CKD evaluation may not be applicable in this population with a unique genetic predisposition and phenotype. A wider understanding of dietary and lifestyle influences, genetic and metabolic risk factors, and the pitfalls of conventional equations estimating kidney function in this population are required in providing care for kidney diseases. Targeted screening of this population for metabolic and vascular risk factors and individualized management plan for disease management may be necessary. Addressing unhealthy dietary patterns, promoting physical activity, and medication management that adheres to cultural factors are crucial steps to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular disease and CKD in this population.

412,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histological lesion with a variety of potential causes, including rare variants of podocyte-related genes. Recently, it has been found that variants in the TBC1D8B gene on the X chromosome can lead to early-onset focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome by affecting endocytosis and recycling of nephrin. Here, we report a 19-year-old Chinese patient with nephrotic syndrome and normal kidney function. He had a complete remission of nephrotic syndrome after full-dose prednisone and cyclosporine treatment. Unfortunately, a relapse of nephrotic syndrome occurred during prednisone tapering. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was proven by a kidney biopsy, and a hemizygous pathogenic variant located in the TBC (Tre-2-Bub2-Cdc16) domain of TBC1D8B was detected by whole-exome sequencing. By comparing our case with reports of other patients with TBC1D8B variants, we suggest possible genotype-phenotype correlations.

In this study, we report the generation of a chimeric form of thrombomodulin with streptavidin (SA-TM) for transient display on the surface of islets modified with biotin to mitigate IBMIR. SA-TM protein expressed in insect cells showed the expected structural and functional features. SA-TM converted protein C into activated protein C, blocked phagocytosis of xenogeneic cells by mouse macrophages and inhibited neutrophil activation. SA-TM was effectively displayed on the surface of biotinylated islets without a negative effect on their viability or function. Islets engineered with SA-TM showed improved engraftment and established euglycemia in 83% of diabetic recipients when compared with 29% of recipients transplanted with SA-engineered islets as control in a syngeneic minimal mass intraportal transplantation model. Enhanced engraftment and function of SA-TM-engineered islets were associated with the inhibition of intragraft proinflammatory innate cellular and soluble mediators of IBMIR, such as macrophages, neutrophils, high-mobility group box 1, tissue factor, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ.

450,"Induced regulatory T (iT<sub>reg</sub>) cells play a vital role in immune tolerance and in controlling chronic inflammation. Generated in the periphery, iT<sub>reg</sub> cells are suitable for responding to alloantigens and preventing transplant rejection. Nevertheless, their clinical application has been impeded by the plasticity and instability attributed to the loss of forkhead box protein 3 expression, raising concerns that iT<sub>reg</sub> may be converted to effector T cells and even exert a pathogenic effect. Herein, second-generation short hairpin RNAs loaded with 3 pairs of small interfering RNAs were utilized to target the T-box transcription factor TBX21. In addition, 2 immunosuppressive cytokines, namely, transforming growth factor beta and interleukin 10, were constitutively expressed. This novel engineering strategy allowed the generation of stably induced regulatory T (SI T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which maintained the expression of forkhead box protein 3 even in an unfavorable environment and exerted potent immunosuppressive functions in vitro. Furthermore, SI T<sub>reg</sub> cells demonstrated an effector transcriptional profile.

453,"Medication nonadherence is a leading cause of graft loss. Adherence monitoring technologies-reminder texts, smart bottles, video-observed ingestion, and digestion-activated signaling pills-may support adherence. However, patient, care partner, and clinician perceptions of these tools are not well studied. We conducted qualitative individual semistructured interviews and focus groups among 97 participants at a single center: kidney and liver transplant recipients 2 weeks to 18 months posttransplant, their care partners, and transplant clinicians. We assessed adherence practices, reactions to monitoring technologies, and opportunities for care integration. One-size-fits-all approaches were deemed infeasible. Interviewees considered text messages the most acceptable approach; live video checks were the least acceptable and raised the most concerns for inconvenience and invasiveness. Digestion-activated signaling technology produced both excitement and apprehension. Patients and care partners generally aligned in perceptions of adherence monitoring integration into clinical care. Key themes were importance of routine, ease of use, leveraging technology for actionable medication changes, and aversion to surveillance.

475,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney failure, and kidney replacement therapies are associated with high symptom burden and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Symptoms change with disease progression or transition between treatment modalities and frequently go unreported and unmanaged. Tools that reliably monitor symptoms may improve the management of patients with CKD. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess symptom severity; physical, psychological, social, and cognitive functioning; treatment-related side effects; and HRQOL. Systematic use of PROMs can improve patient-provider communication, patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and HRQOL. Potential barriers to their use include a lack of engagement, response burden, and limited guidance about PROM collection, score interpretation, and workflow integration. Well-defined, acceptable, and effective clinical response pathways are essential for implementing PROMs. PROMs developed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) address some challenges and may be suitable for clinical use among patients with CKD. PROMIS tools assess multiple patient-valued, clinically actionable symptoms and functions. They can be administered as fixed-length, customized short forms or computer adaptive tests, offering precise measurement across a range of symptom severities or function levels, tailored questions to individuals, and reduced question burden.

501,"Declining kidney function in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is often attributed to large lesions, including angiomyolipomas (AMLs) and cysts, that encroach on the normal parenchyma or that require intervention and loss of parenchyma from surgical debulking or embolization. Consequently, research on inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein complex implicated in TSC pathophysiology for its role in promoting cell growth and proliferation, has largely focused on their ability to reduce AML size. Clinical guidelines distilled from this research limit mTOR inhibition as a first-line treatment to patients with large AMLs. However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in patients without large AMLs or a history of renal intervention. Alternate mechanisms postulated for CKD in TSC may suggest a role for mTOR inhibition in this population.

507,"Electrolyte and acid-base disorders are frequently encountered in patients with malignancy, either due to cancer itself or as a complication of its therapy. However, spurious electrolyte disorders can complicate the interpretation and management of these patients. Several electrolytes can be artifactually increased or decreased such that the serum electrolyte values do not correspond to their actual systemic levels, potentially resulting in extensive diagnostic investigations and therapeutic interventions. Examples of spurious derangements include pseudohyponatremia, pseudohypokalemia, pseudohyperkalemia, pseudohypophosphatemia, pseudohyperphosphatemia, and artifactual acid-base abnormalities. Correctly interpreting these artifactual laboratory abnormalities is imperative for avoiding unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in cancer patients. The factors influencing these spurious results also must be recognized, along with the steps to minimize them.

516,"Kidney transplant recipients undergo lifelong monitoring of allograft function and evaluation for transplant complications. The current monitoring paradigm utilizes blood, urine, and tissue markers that are insensitive, nonspecific, or invasive to obtain. As a result, problems are detected late, after significant damage has accrued, and often beyond the time at which complete resolution is possible. Indeed, most kidney transplants eventually fail, usually because of chronic rejection and other undetected injury. There is a clear need for a transplant-specific biomarker that enables a proactive approach to monitoring via early detection of reversible pathology. A biomarker that supports timely and personalized treatment would assist in achieving the ultimate goal of improving allograft survival and limiting therapeutic toxicity to the recipient. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) has been proposed as one such transplant biomarker. Although the test is presently utilized most in the United States, it is conceivable that its use will become more widespread. This review covers aspects of ddcfDNA that support informed use of the test by general nephrologists, including the basic biology of ddcfDNA, methodological nuances of testing, and general recommendations for use in the kidney transplant population.

524,"Small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) following living donor liver transplantation is a complication that can lead to devastating outcomes such as prolonged poor graft function and possibly graft loss. Because of the concern about the syndrome, some transplants of mismatched grafts may not be performed. Portal hyperperfusion of a small graft and hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation are recognized as main pathogenic factors for the syndrome. Management of established SFSS is guided by the severity of the presentation with the initial focus on pharmacological therapy to modulate portal flow and provide supportive care to the patient with the goal of facilitating graft regeneration and recovery. When medical management fails or condition progresses with impending dysfunction or even liver failure, interventional radiology (IR) and/or surgical interventions to reduce portal overperfusion should be considered. Although most patients have good outcomes with medical, IR, and/or surgical management that allow graft regeneration, the risk of graft loss increases dramatically in the setting of bilirubin >10 mg/dL and INR>1.6 on postoperative day 7 or isolated bilirubin >20 mg/dL on postoperative day 14. Retransplantation should be considered based on the overall clinical situation and the above postoperative laboratory parameters.

526,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare and devastating complication of kidney transplantation, which often leads to graft failure. Posttransplant TMA (PT-TMA) may occur either de novo or as a recurrence of the disease. De novo TMA can be triggered by immunosuppressant drugs, antibody-mediated rejection, viral infections, and ischemia/reperfusion injury in patients with no evidence of the disease before transplantation. Recurrent TMA may occur in the kidney grafts of patients with a history of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in the native kidneys. Studies have shown that some patients with aHUS carry genetic abnormalities that affect genes that code for complement regulators (CFH, MCP, CFI) and components (C3 and CFB), whereas in 10% of patients (mostly children), anti-FH autoantibodies have been reported. The incidence of aHUS recurrence is determined by the underlying genetic or acquired complement abnormality. Although treatment of the causative agents is usually the first line of treatment for de novo PT-TMA, this approach might be insufficient. Plasma exchange typically resolves hematologic abnormalities but does not improve kidney function.

These devices have undergone significant technological advancements over the years, and contemporary LVADs prolong life substantially in patients dependent on inotropic therapy or in those with severe ambulatory advanced heart failure with a median survival that exceeds 5 y, and most patients benefit from a doubling in functional capacity, even among those intended as destination therapy because of ineligibility for transplantation. Other intended goals for LVAD implantation consist of (1) bridge to remission or recovery and (2) bridge to transplant or candidacy for transplant. In the former situation, few selected patients underwent LVAD implantation, facilitating myocardial remission to recovery that allowed explantation. Among those bridged to transplantation, survival in the intended goal was excellent, with 80% success at 5 y (with a 50% rate of transplantation).

These include the ability to provide a continuous supply of new metabolic substrates, clear metabolic waste products, and perform some degree of organ viability assessment before actual transplantation in the recipient.

550,"Regulatory B cells (Breg) modulate the immune response in diverse disease settings including transplantation. Despite the lack of a specific phenotypic marker or transcription factor, their significance in transplantation is underscored by their ability to prolong experimental allograft survival, the possibility for their clinical use as immune monitoring tools, and the exciting prospect for them to form the basis for cell therapy. Interleukin (IL)-10 expression remains the most widely used marker for Breg. Several Breg subsets with distinct phenotypes that express this ""signature Breg cytokine"" have been described in mice and humans. Although T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin family-1 is the most inclusive and functional marker that accounts for murine Breg with disparate mechanisms of action, the significance of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin family-1 as a marker for Breg in humans still needs to be explored. Although the primary focus of this review is the role of Breg in clinical transplantation, the net modulatory effect of B cells on the immune response and clinical outcomes is the result of the balancing functions of both Breg and effector B cells. Supporting this notion, B-cell IL-10/tumor necrosis factor α ratio is shown to predict immunologic reactivity and clinical outcomes in kidney and liver transplantation. Assessment of Breg:B effector balance using their IL-10/tumor necrosis factor α ratio may identify patients that require more immunosuppression and provide mechanistic insights into potential therapies.

Recent preclinical success using genetically modified pig donors in baboon recipients has demonstrated survival greater than 6 mo, with a modern understanding of xenotransplantation immunobiology and continued experience with large animal models of cardiac xenotransplantation. As a direct result of this expertise, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first in-human transplantation of a genetically engineered cardiac xenograft through an expanded access application for a single patient. This clinical case demonstrated the feasibility of xenotransplantation. Although this human study demonstrated proof-of-principle application of cardiac xenotransplantation, further regulatory oversight by the Food and Drug Administration may be required with preclinical trials in large animal models of xenotransplantation with long-term survival before approval of a more formalized clinical trial.

558,"Donor-specific tolerance remains a goal in transplantation because it could improve graft survival and reduce morbidity. Cotransplantation of donor hematopoietic cells to achieve chimerism is a promising approach for tolerance induction, which was successfully tested in clinical trials. However, current protocols are associated with side effects related to the myelosuppressive recipient conditioning, which makes it difficult to introduce them as standard therapy. More recently, adoptive cell therapy with polyclonal or donor-specific regulatory T cells (Treg) proved safe and feasible in several transplant trials, but it is unclear whether it can induce tolerance on its own. The combination of both approaches-Treg therapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation-leads to chimerism and tolerance without myelosuppressive treatment in murine models. Treg therapy promotes engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic cells, reducing conditioning requirements and enhancing regulatory mechanisms maintaining tolerance.

BK virus and other infections can induce damage that resembles the clinical pathology of rejection, and this complicates accurate diagnosis. Moreover, T cells specific for viral infection can lead to rejection through heterologous immunity to donor antigen directly mediated by antiviral cells.

567,"This review outlines the molecular disease states in kidney transplant biopsies as documented in the development of the Molecular Microscope Diagnostic System (MMDx). These states include T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), recent parenchymal injury, and irreversible atrophy-fibrosis. The MMDx project, initiated through a Genome Canada grant, is a collaboration involving many centers. MMDx uses genome-wide microarrays to measure transcript expression, interprets the results using ensembles of machine learning algorithms, and generates a report. Experimental studies in mouse models and cell lines were extensively used to annotate molecular features and interpret the biopsy results. Over time, MMDx revealed unexpected aspects of the disease states: for example, AMR is usually C4d-negative and often DSA-negative, and subtle ""Minor"" AMR-like states are frequent. Parenchymal injury correlates with both reduced glomerular filtration rate and increased risk of graft loss. In kidneys with rejection, injury features, not rejection activity, are the strongest predictors of graft survival. Both TCMR and AMR produce injury, but TCMR induces immediate nephron injury and accelerates atrophy-fibrosis, whereas AMR induces microcirculation and glomerular damage that slowly leads to nephron failure and atrophy-fibrosis. Plasma donor-derived cell-free DNA levels correlate strongly with AMR activity, acute kidney injury, and in a complex way with TCMR activity.

573,"Solid organ transplantation saves thousands of lives suffering from end-stage diseases. Although early transplants experienced acute organ injury, medical breakthroughs, such as tissue typing, and use of immunosuppressive agents have considerably improved graft survival. However, the overall incidence of allograft injury and chronic rejection remains high. Often the clinical manifestations of organ injury or rejection are nonspecific and late. Current requirement for successful organ transplantation is the identification of reliable, accurate, disease-specific, noninvasive methods for the early diagnosis of graft injury or rejection. Development of noninvasive techniques is important to allow routine follow-ups without the discomfort and risks associated with a graft biopsy. Multiple biofluids have been successfully tested for the presence of potential proteomic biomarkers; these include serum, plasma, urine, and whole blood. Kidney transplant research has provided significant evidence to the potential of proteomics-based biomarkers for acute and chronic kidney rejection, delayed graft function, early detection of declining allograft health. Multiple proteins have been implicated as biomarkers; however, recent observations implicate the use of similar canonical pathways and biofunctions associated with graft injury/rejection with altered proteins as potential biomarkers.

589,"Aging affects immunity broadly through changes caused by immunosenescence, clinically resulting in augmented susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, and cancer. The most striking alterations associated with immunosenescence have been observed in the T-cell compartment with a significant shift toward a terminally differentiated memory phenotype taking on features of innate immune cells. At the same time, cellular senescence impairs T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions, compromising the effectiveness of immunity. In clinical transplantation, T-cell immunosenescence has been the main driver of less frequent acute rejections in older transplant recipients. This patient population, at the same time, suffers more frequently from the side effects of immunosuppressive therapy including higher rates of infections, malignancies, and chronic allograft failure. T-cell senescence has also been identified as an instigator of age-specific organ dysfunction through a process that has been coined ""inflammaging,"" accelerating organ injury and potentially contributing to the limited lifetime of organ transplants. Here, we provide a summary of the latest evidence on molecular characteristics of T-cell senescence affecting alloimmunity and organ quality while dissecting the consequences of unspecific organ injury and immunosuppression on T-cell senescence.

Changes to our retrieval protocol have resulted in a higher retrieval rate from DCD donors and fewer rejections of DCD hearts during normothermic machine perfusion.

613,"Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (caAMR) is arguably the most important cause of late kidney allograft failure. However, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for acute or chronic AMR and there is no consensus on effective treatment. Many trials in transplantation have failed because of slow and/or inadequate enrollment, and no new agent has been approved by the FDA for transplantation in over a decade. Several lines of evidence suggest that interleukin-6 is an important driver of AMR, and clazakizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin-6, has shown promising results in phase 2 studies. The IMAGINE trial (Interleukin-6 Blockade Modifying Antibody-mediated Graft Injury and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Decline) (NCT03744910) is the first to be considered by the FDA using a reasonably likely surrogate endpoint (slope of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline >1 y) for accelerated approval and is the only ongoing clinical trial for the treatment of chronic rejection.
